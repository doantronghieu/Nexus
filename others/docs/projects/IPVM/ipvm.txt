Cloud is going mainstream in video surveillance. Based on IPVM's research and reporting, here are key changes driving this. Just in the last few months:

Genetec has launched a new SaaS architecture with cloud at its core
Axis has launched a new "Cloud Connect" architecture with open support for 3rd party VSaaSes
Axon acquired Fusus, valued at $300 million, with great ambitions to expand cloud-based real-time crime centers.
RapidSOS has launched cloud connectivity for cameras to emergency 911 operators, with Eagle Eye as its first partner.
Hanwha has launched a new OnCloud platform.
Motorola has expanded its cloud to add alarm and remote monitoring.
This builds on:

2 years ago, Motorola spending nearly $400 million on cloud startup Ava and putting it at the core of its new Alta platform.
Last year, Verkada raised $205 million, and EagleEye raised $100 million
Alarm.com's acquisition of OpenEyeand expansion into commercial.
Numerous companies such as Arcules, Eagle Eye, Qumulex, Spot.AI, Turing Vivotek, and YourSix are releasing their own cloud offerings.
In IPVM's 16 years of analyzing the market, including with the shift from analog to megaipxel / IP cameras, such broad support is key to moving to the next generation.

With a critical mass of incumbents and major players adopting cloud, buyers now have many options, including from existing suppliers to go to cloud, and large sellers will now heavily market cloud, as they have their own offerings.

IPVM believes that in the next decade, this will result in the dominance of mega cloud providers

With far better video analytics, power to solve crimes, firmware / device management, and embedded support. But also with growing privacy concerns and risks of reduced competition and greater lock-in.

Follow IPVM's latest research and reporting to understand what is causing this and where the market is going.

Internet Protocol Video Market (IPVM) is a security and surveillance industry research group and trade publication based in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania that focuses on reviewing and reporting on video-surveillance technology.[1][4][5][6]

IPVM was launched in 2008 out of Hawaii, when founder John Honovich had left the surveillance industry after becoming disillusioned with what he described as "overstated marketing claims" that pervaded the industry.[5][6] Soon after launching, IPVM's headquarters moved to Pennsylvania, where most of its employees were living.[5] The website began as a news aggregator, though the company would grow to produce original investigations and conduct its own reviews of surveillance equipment. Throughout most of its history, the publication's readership and reach has been specific to the surveillance industry.[6]

IPVM gained broader recognition in 2020 and 2021 for its investigative reporting revealing how PRC-based technology firms Alibaba,[4][7][8] Dahua Technology,[9][10] Huawei[9][11][12] and Megvii[9][10] filed patents for face detection technology designed to target Uyghurs. The company's investigations on surveillance equipment used in China have been widely cited by major newspapers in the United States, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and The Washington Post.[6] Its reports have drawn the ire of Chinese video surveillance equipment company Hikvision, whom IPVM revealed to have been providing surveillance equipment and technology key in the mass internment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.[13] China has been critical of the company, blocking the company's website within Great Firewall,[6] while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China has denied the validity of IPVM's work relating to Huawei, claiming it was "slander".[14] In 2023 and 2024, respectively, IPVM reporting was cited by the U.S. Department of State in its Xinjiang 2022 International Religious Freedom Report and by the Select Committee on the CCP in a report on how U.S. venture capital aids the Chinese Communist Party.[15][16]

Unlike many trade publications focused on the surveillance industry, IPVM does not accept advertising from manufacturers of surveillance technology, owing to its founder's concern around the potential for advertisers to affect the publication's editorial independence.[6] Instead, the privately-owned website runs on a subscription-based model; as of January 2020, IPVM said that it maintained over 10,000 subscribers.[5]

History
IPVM was launched in 2008 out of Hawaii, when founder John Honovich had left the surveillance industry after becoming disillusioned with what he described as "overstated marketing claims" that pervaded the industry.[17][5][6] Soon after launching, IPVM's headquarters moved to Pennsylvania, where most of its employees were living.[5] The website began as a news aggregator, though the company would grow to produce original investigations and conduct its own reviews of surveillance equipment.[6] However, the publication would begin to gain notoriety more broadly following its investigations into Chinese surveillance firms.[6] After publishing reports critical of Chinese video surveillance firms Hikvision and Dahua Technology, the Chinese government blocked IPVM behind its Great Firewall on October 19, 2018.[6][18] Reporters Without Borders subsequently condemned the Chinese government’s decision.[18]

In December 2019, IPVM would move again, leaving its headquarters in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for a 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) research facility in the residential Miller Heights neighborhood Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The new location allows IPVM to conduct on-site video surveillance hardware and software tests on products from a variety of leading video surveillance manufacturers.[5] In March 2021, the Journal of Biomedical Optics published a study by five IPVM researchers and a U.S. military medical service officer on the problems with COVID-19 fever screening devices. The study was funded by IPVM and was conducted at the new facility.[19]

In 2023, Time recognized John Honovich, IPVM’s founder, as one of the 100 Most Influential People in AI, citing IPVM as “a leading source of information on the harms of facial-recognition technology” as well as the organization’s influence on U.S. policy.[20]

China technology companies' involvement in the persecution of Uyghurs
Further information: Persecution of Uyghurs in China
In May 2021, the BBC aired Are You Scared Yet, Human?, a Panorama documentary featuring an interview with IPVM on Dahua Technology's, Hikvision's, and Huawei's roles in developing mass surveillance technologies in China, including technological products designed to identify Uyghurs.[21] In September 2021, IPVM presented an expert statement to the Uyghur Tribunal in the United Kingdom.[22][23]

In 2022, IPVM, in association with Ethan Gutmann from the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and Bob Fu from ChinaAid, among others, helped Ovalbek Turdakun, a Kyrgyz Christian Xinjiang internment camps survivor, escape to the United States,[24] where he was granted significant public benefit parole.[25][26] Turdakun gave first-person witness testimony about his alleged detention during an April press conference led by IPVM's Conor Healy and the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.[24]

In 2023, IPVM obtained a Hikvision private meeting recording during which Pierre-Richard Prosper, who had been hired by Hikvision to investigate its ties to human rights abuses in Xinjiang, said his team was “not going to absolve” Hikvision and that the company had bid on Chinese government contracts that targeted Uyghurs as a group.[27] The Register later reported that IPVM found that Hikvision and Nvidia had been retained by Chengmai County authorities as recently as December 2022 to provide Uyghur-identifying technologies.[28]

Joint investigations
In 2020, The Washington Post and IPVM jointly reported on Huawei's testing of facial recognition technology designed to identify Uyghurs.[29][30]

In 2021, IPVM partnered with TechCrunch to examine U.S. local governments' purchases and U.S. retailers' sales of surveillance equipment manufactured by companies linked to abuses of Uyghurs[31][32] as well as with The Intercept to investigate the U.S. military's purchase of sanctioned cameras for the U.S. embassy in Caracas.[33]

In 2022, IPVM partnered with the MIT Technology Review to examine an Israeli company's plan to develop DNA-based facial recognition[34] and was cited in an ESPN exposé on Brooklyn Nets owner Joseph Tsai discussing Alibaba's, Megvii's and SenseTime's Uyghur-targeting software.[35]

In 2023, the BBC cited IPVM in its reporting on shortcomings with Evolv’s AI weapons scanners.[36] [37]

Reaction
Evolv
In March 2024, Evolv, a publicly traded Massachusetts-based security and technology company contemporaneously under investigation by the FTC and the SEC,[38] issued a press release criticizing IPVM as a “biased” “tabloid publication” that has published “inaccurate and misleading coverage.”[39]

Hikvision
In July 2021, Hikvision resigned its membership in the Security Industry Association, a U.S.-based trade association, citing in its resignation letter that it had been "harassed and maligned" by IPVM.[40][41][42] Hikvision further claimed that IPVM had engaged in "unethical hacking" of its cameras and that IPVM had published "misleading blog stories."[40][41][42]

In January 2022, Axios reported that Hikvision had asked U.S. congressional ethics officials to investigate potential lobbying disclosure violations by IPVM.[43] U.S. senator Marco Rubio and congresswoman Claudia Tenney retweeted the Axios article,[44][45] urging their congressional colleagues to ignore Hikvision while claiming that Hikvision's accusations against IPVM amounted to censorship.[44][45][46]

Chinese state media
In November 2021, Global Times, a tabloid under the auspices of the Chinese Communist Party, published an article by Gao Lei writing under the pen name 耿直哥,[47] or Candid Brother, to its Baidu[48] and WeChat[49] accounts criticizing IPVM as a U.S. government mouthpiece parading as a civilian company. Lei also compared IPVM founder John Honovich to German anthropologist Adrian Zenz and claimed that another IPVM employee is "a rather extreme white right-winger."[48][49]

In January 2022, China Daily, a Chinese Communist Party-owned newspaper, published an article and a video noting IPVM's work with the BBC, The New York Times, Reuters, and The Washington Post, criticizing it as a "mass surveillance company" that has "been sharing tons of data they have collected on Xinjiang and on other Chinese entities."[50]

PUBLIC - This article does not require an IPVM subscription. Feel free to share.
IPVM AI is launched - try a demo here - or watch the 1-minute video below to learn more:



While it will be a premium enterprise offering, we are still determining how to price and package IPVM AI. If you are interested in IPVM AI, you can request access here.

The Vision

The vision is to deliver a full platform where technology professionals can get answers to various technological, operational, financial, and strategic questions to deliver much faster, better decisions. A single source where trusted, vetted information by our research, reporting, and software development teams help you in daily and major decisions.

Unified

One core component of our vision is what we call "unified" answers. Rather than using various systems or sites, IPVM AI delivers immediate unified answers across multiple sources to your questions:

IPVM's proprietary research and reporting, which is cleaned, optimized, and expanded daily.
Company websites: We are starting with 28 companies' websites, indexing and retrieving the most relevant responses so you can, at the same time, get their perspective and stance. [We plan to have well over 100 company websites by the end of Q1 2025.]
GPT-4o: In addition to IPVM reporting and company websites, we also return results from Open AI's GPT-4o so users can compare and contrast.
On-page: Plus, on IPVM's reporting or on any page on the Interest, using our Web extension, get answers from the information on the page as well as the above.
Rather than searching through various websites and sources, IPVM AI delivers a wealth of information simultaneously and immediately.

IPVM "Everywhere"

A second core component of our vision is what we call IPVM "Everywhere." Rather than just an AI page (which we, of course, have), we have already developed:

Web extensions, already available in the Chrome Web store, bring IPVM AI to any page on the Internet, so you can check vendor marketing claims, tap into IPVM's research, and more wherever you go.
Slack integration, already deployed and available by contacting us, brings IPVM AI to your team's internal communication so you can ask and get answers while using Slack. Up next is a Microsoft Teams integration for the same reason.
Every IPVM report: AI users can now use IPVM AI to ask questions and learn more about every IPVM report, making it far easier to address your specific needs. We view this implementation as the future of journalism and research, generally, as it is much better than manually determining where a topic is covered in the report.
On IPVM's homepage, you can pick through reports, as traditional, but now you can immediately ask IPVM AI any question you want as soon as you load IPVM.
Highlights of Features

We have a dedicated page for asking IPVM AI:

IPVM Image

It also includes options (under "Mode" above) to adjust the length of the response (brief or detailed) and the tone of the response (supportive or critical), with the former being more for sales or marketing people and the latter for product / engineering team members.

Our unified responses will generate answers from IPVM AI, the company's own website as relevant, and GPT 4o side by side:

On the homepage, IPVM AI is embedded on the right-hand side so that users can pick from going straight to IPVM reports or immediately asking questions they have:

IPVM Image

IPVM AI is embedded into every IPVM report on the right-hand side, making it simple and quick to ask any questions about any report:

IPVM Image

Our Web Extension (available on Chrome already and soon for Edge and Firefox) allows you to ask questions and get information from IPVM AI on any webpage, e.g., below on a Verkada webpage:

You can also ask IPVM AI questions on Slack, as shown below:

Plus, we have AI quiz generation on every report, and users can click on the Quiz Me Button to auto-generate quizzes on whatever topics they prefer:

Lessons Learned

An important lesson learned is that you cannot simply bolt AI onto your information.

Many organizations have discussed with us their interest in taking their own internal documents and adding AI to them. This is going to be hard to do well.

We have an advantage in that we only used IPVM reporting with specific editorial standards and reviews required to be published. Even with that, we spent many months developing software and cleaning data to eliminate redundancies, correct out-of-date information, and improve answers to various questions (a process we now do every day).

While we are increasingly happy with our results, we recommend caution in doing so within your organization unless you are willing to commit significant resources to improving the quality of your data (which will likely be even more challenging if you include emails and other documents from various employees that are commonplace and not editorially reviewed).

The Future

On the one hand, IPVM AI is already vastly better than when we first demonstrated it at GSX 2024 in September. In four months, it went from a simplistic one-page interface to adding all the features we showed above.

On the other hand, we see an equal amount of improvements that we are already planning to make, including delivering far better AI-based education, our own domain-specific tuned model, and a variety of advanced features specific to common physical security tasks. We will be announcing them periodically across 2025.

Questions

We are excited about the foundation already laid and how it has already helped our internal productivity over the last few months. We are confident it will radically improve how you learn and make decisions.

Please feel free to ask questions in the comments. We only highlighted major points to start and are happy to elaborate. Also, try the demo, which can answer various questions as well.
