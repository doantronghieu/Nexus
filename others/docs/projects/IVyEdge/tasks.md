# Project Tasks

## **Multilingual Support Implementation (Japanese/German)**
- Research, evaluate, and test open-source speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models optimized for Japanese
- Integrate the selected models into the system

## RAG

### Algorithms Improvements
- Implement a hybrid retrieval system
- Optimize chunk size and overlap strategies
- Design a reranking pipeline for results

### Develop Input Data Processing Pipeline
- Design a document pre-processing pipeline
- Create a metadata extraction system

### Develop Evaluation Pipeline
- Define retrieval quality metrics
- Implement an automated evaluation pipeline
- Create a ground truth dataset
- Design a testing framework

## Car Control
- Explore methods to optimize LLM calls within the pipeline
- Conduct a survey of LLM engine solutions with fast inference capabilities
- Evaluate system performance using vLLM engine
- Conduct a survey and implement LLM fine-tuning solutions
- Conduct a survey and implement LLM RLHF solutions
- Develop a custom LLM multi-agent system (Optional)

## Navigation Feature
- Conduct a survey on open-source navigation solutions
- Develop a prototype for the navigation feature
- Integrate the navigation feature into the LLM agent
- Evaluate the LLM agent's performance for navigation queries
  
## Music Player Integration (Optional)
- Conduct research on open-source music player solutions
- Develop a prototype for the music player 
- Integrate the music player with the LLM agent architecture
- Evaluate the LLM agent's performance for music playback

## Test

- Evaluate the performance of IvyEdge across various devices

## TODOs

- Create an Excel sheet for tasks, define milestones/priority, and assign members
- Develop a prototype framework, limit hardware resources, set up a Docker environment, include IvyEdge features, specify model types (ONNX, bin, etc.), manage memory, resources, and temperature, and implement in C++
- Survey optimization techniques (quantization, pruning, etc.) for LLMs
