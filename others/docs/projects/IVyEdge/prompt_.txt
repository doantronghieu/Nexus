Design a NoSQL database schema to model the essential attributes and states of a vehicle, focusing on parameters relevant to everyday drivers. The schema should support core vehicle monitoring and control operations, prioritizing data commonly accessed through dashboard and control systems in most cars.

Analyze the problem step by step through the systematic and careful use of sequential thinking.

Provide the result as an artifact.

I want to build a car control dashboard that includes all core functionalities of a car. 

The dashboard will export all car data to a JSON file, simulating interactions with car parameters through the JSON file. 

No information related to ADAS is needed. No schema metadata, tenant configuration, validation rules, real-time configuration, lifecycle management, performance configuration, or update frequency are required.
