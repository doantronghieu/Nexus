[Prompt] Instructs the AI to handle both specific queries and general or emotional statements. For the latter, it will infer the most likely intent, ask for confirmation, and then proceed with the appropriate action if confirmed. This approach allows for a more natural and intuitive interaction with the user, addressing their needs even when they don't make specific requests.
