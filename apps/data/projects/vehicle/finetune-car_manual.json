  {
    "instruction": "Why is it recommended to install child restraint systems in the rear seat?",

  {
    "instruction": "Can a child restraint system be installed in the front passenger seat?",
    "output": "While it's not recommended, if unavoidable, the front passenger seat should be adjusted as follows: move it fully rearward, adjust to the uppermost position if height is adjustable, set the seatback to the most upright position, and ensure the 'AIR BAG OFF' indicator is illuminated for forward-facing seats."

    "instruction": "What precaution should be taken when using seat belt extenders with child restraint systems?",
    "output": "Do not use a seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system, as it may not securely hold the system, increasing the risk of injury in an accident. If a seat belt extender is used when installing a child restraint system, the seat belt will not securely hold the child restraint system."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "What is the LATCH system and what does it conform to?",
    "output": "LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) is a system for attaching child restraint systems in vehicles. It conforms to FMVSS225 or CMVSS210.2 standards. The LATCH system is designed to make the installation of child restraint systems easier and more secure, using dedicated anchors instead of the vehicle's seat belts."
