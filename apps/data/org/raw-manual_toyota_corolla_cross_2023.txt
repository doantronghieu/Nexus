Therefore, you may find explanations for equipment not installed on your vehicle and the illustrations used may differ from your vehicle.\nAll specifications provided in this manual are current at the time of printing. Over time, your vehicle may receive updates that modify the vehicle and make material in this manual incomplete and/or inaccurate. Because of Toyota's interest in continual product improvement, Toyota reserves the right to make changes to this manual at any time without notice.\nIf Toyota chooses to update the manual, updated versions can be viewed by selecting your vehicle by model and year at the following URL or on your mobile device if you have access to the Toyota app.\nwww.toyota.com/owners\nNoise from under vehicle after turning off the engine\nApproximately five hours after the engine is turned off, you may hear sound coming from\nunder the vehicle for several minutes. This is the sound of a fuel evaporation leakage check and, it does not indicate a malfunction.\nAccessories, spare parts and modification of your Toyota\nA wide variety of non-genuine spare parts and accessories for Toyota vehicles are currently available in the market. You should know that Toyota does not warrant these products and is not responsible for their performance, repair, or replacement, or for any damage they may cause to, or adverse effect they may have on, your Toyota vehicle.\nThis vehicle should not be modified with non-genuine Toyota products. Modification with non-genuine Toyota products could affect its performance, safety or durability, and may even violate governmental regulations. In addition, damage or performance problems resulting from the modification may not be covered under warranty.\nAlso, remodeling like this will have an effect on advanced safety equipment such as Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 and there is a danger that it will not work properly or the danger that it\n7\n8\nmay work in situations where it should not be working.\nInstallation of a mobile two-way radio system\nThe installation of a mobile two-way radio system in your vehicle could affect electronic systems such as:\n\uf06c Multiport fuel injection sys-\ntem/sequential multiport fuel injection system\n\uf06c Toyota Safety Sense 2.0\n\uf06c Anti-lock brake system\n\uf06c SRS airbag system\n\uf06c Seat belt pretensioner system\nBe sure to check with your Toyota dealer for precautionary measures or special instructions regarding installation of a mobile two-way radio system.\nVehicle data recording\nThe vehicle is equipped with sophisticated computers that will record certain data, such as: • Engine speed/Electric motor speed (traction motor speed)\nAccelerator status • Brake status • Vehicle speed • Operation status of the driving assist systems\nImages from the cameras\nYour vehicle is equipped with cameras. Contact your Toyota dealer for the location of recording cameras.\nThe recorded data varies according to the vehicle grade level and options with which it is equipped.\nThese computers do not record conversations or sounds, and only record images outside of the vehicle in certain situations.\n\uf06c Data Transmission\nYour vehicle may transmit the data recorded in these computers to Toyota without notification to you.\n\uf06c Data usage\nToyota may use the data recorded in this computer to diagnose malfunctions, conduct research and development, and improve quality.\nToyota will not disclose the recorded data to a third party except:\nWith the consent of the vehicle owner or with the consent of the lessee if the vehicle is leased\nIn response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency\nFor use by Toyota in a lawsuit\nFor research purposes where the data is not tied to a specific vehicle or vehicle owner \uf06c Recorded image information can be erased by your Toyota dealer.\nThe image recording function can be disabled. However, if the function is disabled, data from when the\nsystem operates will not be available.\n\uf06c To learn more about the vehicle data collected, used and shared by Toyota, please visit www.toyota.com/privacyvts/.\nUsage of data collected through Safety Connect (U.S. mainland only)\nIf your Toyota has Safety Connect and if you have subscribed to those services, please refer to the Safety Connect Telematics Subscription Service Agreement for information on data collected and its usage.\n\uf06c To learn more about the vehicle data collected, used and shared by Toyota, please visit www.toyota.com/privacyvts/.\nEvent data recorder\nThis vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.\nThe EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as: • How various systems in your\nvehicle were operating;\nWhether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;\nHow far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and, • How fast the vehicle was trav-\neling.\nThese data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur.\nNOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can read the\n9\n10\ninformation if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. \uf06c Disclosure of the EDR data\nToyota will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except when:\nAn agreement from the vehicle’s owner (or the lessee for a leased vehicle) is obtained\nIn response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a government agency\nFor use by Toyota in a lawsuit\nHowever, if necessary, Toyota may:\nUse the data for research on vehicle safety performance\nDisclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing information about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner\nScrapping of your Toyota\nThe SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your Toyota contain explosive chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be sure to have the systems of the SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or by your Toyota dealer before you scrap your vehicle.\nPerchlorate Material\nSpecial handling may apply, See www.dtsc.ca.gov/ hazardouswaste/perchlorate.\nYour vehicle has components that may contain perchlorate. These components may include the airbags, seat belt pretensioners, wireless remote control batteries, and the batteries in the tire pressure warning valve and transmitters.\nWARNING\nGeneral precautions while\ndriving\nDriving under the influence: Never drive your vehicle when under the influence of alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to operate your vehicle. Alcohol and certain drugs delay reaction time, impair judgment and reduce coordination, which could lead to an accident that could result in death or serious injury. Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents. Driver distraction: Always give your full attention to driving. Anything that distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you, your occupants or others.\nWARNING\nGeneral precaution regarding\nchildren’s safety\nNever leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to have or use the key. Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral. There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with the windows, the moon roof (if equipped), or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal to children.\n11\n12\nReading this manual\nExplains symbols used in this manual.\nSymbols in this manual\nSymbols\nMeanings\nWARNING:\nExplains something that, if not obeyed, could cause death or serious injury to people.\nNOTICE:\nExplains something that, if not obeyed, could cause damage to or a malfunction in the vehicle or its equipment.\nIndicates operating or working procedures.

For safe use\n1-1.For safe use\nBefore driving\nObserve the following before starting off in the vehicle to ensure safety of driving.\nFloor mat\nUse only floor mats designed specifically for vehicles of the same model and model year as your vehicle. Fix them securely in place onto the carpet. 1 Insert the retaining hooks\n(clips) into the floor mat eyelets.\n2 Turn the upper knob of each retaining hook (clip) to secure the floor mats in place.\nAlways align the\nmarks\n.\nThe shape of the retaining hooks (clips) may differ from that shown in the illustration.\nWARNING\nObserve the following precautions. Failure to do so may cause the driver’s floor mat to slip, possibly interfering with the pedals while driving. An unexpectedly high speed may result or it may become difficult to stop the vehicle. This could lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury. ■ When installing the driver’s\nfloor mat\nDo not use floor mats designed for other models or different model year vehicles, even if they are Toyota Genuine floor mats.\nOnly use floor mats designed for the driver’s seat.\nAlways install the floor mat securely using the retaining hooks (clips) provided.\nDo not use two or more floor mats on top of each other. ● Do not place the floor mat bottom-side up or upside-down.\nWARNING ■ Before driving ●Check that the floor mat is securely fixed in the correct place with all the provided retaining hooks (clips). Be especially careful to perform this check after cleaning the floor.\nWith the engine stopped and the shift lever in P, fully depress each pedal to the floor to make sure it does not interfere with the floor mat.\n1-1. For safe use\nFor safe driving\nFor safe driving, adjust the seat and mirror to an appropriate position before driving.\nCorrect driving posture\nAdjust the angle of the seatback so that you are sitting straight up and so that you do not have to lean forward to steer. (\uf0aeP.124)\nAdjust the seat so that you can depress the pedals fully and so that your arms bend slightly at the elbow when gripping the steering wheel. (\uf0aeP.124)\nLock the head restraint in place with the center of the head restraint closest to the top of your ears. (\uf0aeP.127)\nWear the seat belt correctly. (\uf0aeP.27)\n25\n1\nF o r\ns a f e t y\na n d\ns e c u r i t y\n26\n1-1. For safe use\nWARNING\nFor safe driving Observe the following precautions. Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury. ●Do not adjust the position of the\ndriver’s seat while driving. Doing so could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle. ●Do not place a cushion between the driver or passenger and the seatback. A cushion may prevent correct posture from being achieved, and reduce the effectiveness of the seat belt and head restraint. ●Do not place anything under the\nfront seats. Objects placed under the front seats may become jammed in the seat tracks and stop the seat from locking in place. This may lead to an accident and the adjustment mechanism may also be damaged.\nAlways observe the legal speed limit when driving on public roads.\nWhen driving over long distances, take regular breaks before you start to feel tired. Also, if you feel tired or sleepy while driving, do not force yourself to continue driving and take a break immediately.\nTake care when adjusting the seat position to ensure that other passengers are not injured by the moving seat. ●When adjusting the seat position, do not put your hands under the seat or near the moving parts to avoid injury. Fingers or hands may become jammed in the seat mechanism.\nCorrect use of the seat belts\nMake sure that all occupants are wearing their seat belts before driving the vehicle. (\uf0aeP.27) Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child until the child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. (\uf0aeP.46)\nAdjusting the mirrors\nMake sure that you can see backward clearly by adjusting the inside and outside rear view mirrors properly. (\uf0aeP.130, 131)\nSeat belts\nMake sure that all occupants are wearing their seat belts before driving the vehicle.\nWARNING\nObserve the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident. Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. ■ Wearing a seat belt ●Ensure that all passengers wear\na seat belt.\nAlways wear a seat belt properly.\nEach seat belt should be used by one person only. Do not use a seat belt for more than one person at once, including children.\nToyota recommends that children be seated in the rear seat and always use a seat belt and/or an appropriate child restraint system.\nTo achieve a proper seating position, do not recline the seat more than necessary. The seat belt is most effective when the occupants are sitting up straight and well back in the seats. ●Do not wear the shoulder belt\nunder your arm.\nAlways wear your seat belt low and snug across your hips.\n1-1. For safe use\nPregnant women\nObtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (\uf0aeP.28) Women who are pregnant should position the lap belt as low as possible over the hips in the same manner as other occupants, extending the shoulder belt completely over the shoulder and avoiding belt contact with the rounding of the abdominal area. If the seat belt is not worn properly, not only the pregnant woman, but also the fetus could suffer death or serious injury as a result of sudden braking or a collision. ■ People suffering illness Obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (\uf0aeP.28) ■ When children are in the vehi-\ncle \uf0aeP.59 ■ Seat belt damage and wear ● Do not damage the seat belts by allowing the belt, plate, or buckle to be jammed in the door.\n27\n1\nF o r\ns a f e t y\na n d\ns e c u r i t y\n28\n1-1. For safe use\nWARNING\nInspect the seat belt system periodically. Check for cuts, fraying, and loose parts. Do not use a damaged seat belt until it is replaced. Damaged seat belts cannot protect an occupant from death or serious injury. ●Ensure that the belt and plate are locked and the belt is not twisted. If the seat belt does not function correctly, immediately contact your Toyota dealer.\nReplace the seat assembly, including the belts, if your vehicle has been involved in a serious accident, even if there is no obvious damage.\nDo not attempt to install,\nremove, modify, disassemble or dispose of the seat belts.

The belt should be kept away from your neck, but not falling off your shoulder. Failure to do so could reduce the amount of protection in an accident and cause death or serious injuries in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.\nSeat belt pretensioners (front and outboard rear seats)\nThe pretensioners help the seat belts to quickly restrain the occupants by retracting the seat belts when the vehicle is subjected to certain types of severe frontal or side collision or a vehicle rollover.\nThe pretensioners do not activate in the event of a minor frontal impact, a minor side impact or a rear impact.\nReplacing the belt after the pretensioner has been activated If the vehicle is involved in multiple collisions, the pretensioner will activate for the first collision, but will not activate for the second or subsequent collisions. ■ PCS-linked seat belt preten-\nsioner control\nIf the PCS (Pre-Collision System) determines that the possibility of a collision with a vehicle is high, the seat belt pretensioners will be prepared to operate.\nWARNING\nSeat belt pretensioners Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident. Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. ● Do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat. Doing so will disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor from detecting the passenger’s weight properly. As a result, the seat belt pretensioner for the front passenger’s seat may not activate in the event of a collision.\nIf the pretensioner has activated, the SRS warning light will come on. In that case, the seat belt cannot be used again and must be replaced at your Toyota dealer.\n1-1.

Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury. ●The driver and all passengers in the vehicle must wear their seat belts properly. The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts.\nThe SRS driver airbag deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advises: Since the risk zone for the driver’s airbag is the first 2 3 in. (50 75 mm) of inflation, placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag provides you with a margin of safety. This distance is measured from the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If you sit less than 10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your driving position in several ways: • Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the pedals comfortably.\nSlightly recline the back of the seat. Although vehicle designs vary, many drivers can achieve the 10 in. (250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. If reclining the back of your seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non-slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.\nIf your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the airbag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.\nThe seat should be adjusted as recommended by NHTSA above, while still maintaining control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view of the instrument panel controls.\nWARNING\nIf the seat belt extender has been connected to the front seat belt buckles but the seat belt extender has not also been fastened to the latch plate of the seat belt, the SRS front airbags will judge that the front passenger are wearing the seat belt even though the seat belt has not been connected. In this case, the SRS front airbags may not activate correctly in a collision, resulting in death or serious injury in the event of a collision. Be sure to wear the seat belt with the seat belt extender.\nThe SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and can cause death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very close to the airbag. The front passenger seat should be as far from the airbag as possible with the seatback adjusted, so the front passenger sits upright.\n1-1. For safe use\nImproperly seated and/or\nrestrained infants and children can be killed or seriously injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint system. Toyota strongly recommends that all infants and children be placed in the rear seats of the vehicle and properly restrained. The rear seats are safer for infants and children than the front passenger seat. (\uf0aeP.46)\nDo not sit on the edge of the seat or lean against the dashboard.\nDo not allow a child to stand in front of the SRS front passenger airbag unit or sit on the knees of a front passenger.\nDo not allow the front seat occupants to hold items on their knees.\n37\n1\nF o r\ns a f e t y\na n d\ns e c u r i t y\n38\n1-1. For safe use\nWARNING\nDo not lean against the door, the roof side rail or the front, side and rear pillars.\nDo not allow anyone to kneel on the passenger seats toward the door or put their head or hands outside the vehicle.\nDo not attach anything to or lean anything against areas such as the dashboard, steering wheel pad and lower portion of the instrument panel. These items can become projectiles when the SRS driver, front passenger and knee airbags deploy.\nDo not attach anything to areas such as a door, windshield, side windows, front or rear pillar, roof side rail and assist grip.\nVehicles without a smart key system: Do not attach any heavy, sharp or hard objects such as keys and accessories to the key. The objects may restrict the SRS knee airbag inflation or be thrust into the driver’s seat area by the force of the deploying airbag, thus causing a danger.\nDo not hang hangers or other hard objects on the coat hooks. All of these items could become projectiles and may cause death or serious injury, should the SRS curtain shield airbags deploy.\nIf a vinyl cover is put on the area where the SRS driver’s knee airbag will deploy, be sure to remove it.\nWARNING\nDo not use seat accessories which cover the parts where the SRS side airbags inflate as they may interfere with inflation of the SRS airbags. Such accessories may prevent the side airbags from activating correctly, disable the system or cause the side airbags to inflate accidentally, resulting in death or serious injury.\nDo not strike or apply significant levels of force to the area of the SRS airbag components or the front doors. Doing so can cause the SRS airbags to malfunction.\nDo not touch any of the component parts immediately after the SRS airbags have deployed (inflated) as they may be hot. ●If breathing becomes difficult after the SRS airbags have deployed, open a door or window to allow fresh air in, or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do so. Wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation.\nIf the areas where the SRS airbags are stored, such as the steering wheel pad and front and rear pillar garnishes, are damaged or cracked, have them replaced by your Toyota dealer.\nDo not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat. Doing so will disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor from detecting the passenger’s weight properly. As a result, the SRS front airbags for the front passenger may not deploy in the event of a collision.\n1-1. For safe use\nModification and disposal of SRS airbag system components\nDo not dispose of your vehicle or perform any of the following modifications without consulting your Toyota dealer. The SRS airbags may malfunction or deploy (inflate) accidentally, causing death or serious injury. ● Installation, removal, disassembly and repair of the SRS airbags\nRepairs, modifications, removal or replacement of the steering wheel, instrument panel, dashboard, seats or seat upholstery, front, side and rear pillars, roof side rails, front door panels, front door trims or front door speakers\nModifications to the front door panel (such as making a hole in it)\nRepairs or modifications of the front fender, front bumper, or side of the occupant compartment\nInstallation of a grille guard (bull bars, kangaroo bar, etc.), snow plows, winches or roof luggage carrier\nModifications to the vehicle’s suspension system\nInstallation of electronic devices such as mobile two-way radios and CD players\nModifications to your vehicle for a person with a physical disability\n39\n1\nF o r\ns a f e t y\na n d\ns e c u r i t y\n40\n1-1.

If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illuminated, disconnect the extender tongue from the seat belt buckle, and reconnect the seat belt. Reconnect the seat belt extender after making sure the “AIR BAG ON” indicator light is illuminated. If you use the seat belt extender while the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illuminated, the SRS airbags for the front passenger will not activate, which could cause death or serious injury in the event of a collision. ●Do not apply a heavy load to the front passenger seat or equipment (e.g. seatback pocket). ●Do not put weight on the front passenger seat by putting your hands or feet on the front passenger seat seatback from the rear passenger seat.\nDo not let a rear passenger lift the front passenger seat with their feet or press on the seatback with their legs.\nDo not put objects under the front passenger seat.\n1-1. For safe use\nDo not recline the front passenger seatback so far that it touches a rear seat. This may cause the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light to be illuminated, which indicates that the SRS airbags for the front passenger will not activate in the event of a severe accident. If the seatback touches the rear seat, return the seatback to a position where it does not touch the rear seat. Keep the front passenger seatback as upright as possible when the vehicle is moving. Reclining the seatback excessively may lessen the effectiveness of the seat belt system. ● If an adult sits in the front pas-\nsenger seat, the “AIR BAG ON” indicator light is illuminated. If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator is illuminated, ask the passenger to sit up straight, well back in the seat, feet on the floor, and with the seat belt worn correctly. If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator still remains illuminated, either ask the passenger to move to the rear seat, or if that is not possible, move the front passenger seat fully rearward.\nWhen it is unavoidable to install a forward-facing child restraint system on the front passenger seat, install the child restraint system on the front passenger seat in the proper order. (\uf0aeP.48)\nDo not modify or remove the front seats.\nDo not kick the front passenger seat or subject it to severe impact.

Those guidelines are consistent with the safety standards previously set by the following U.S. and international standards bodies.\n\uf06c ANSI (American National\nStandards Institute) C95.1 [1992]\n\uf06c NCRP (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement) Report 86 [1986]\n\uf06c ICNIRP (International Com-\nmission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) [1996]\nThose standards were based on comprehensive and periodic evaluations of the relevant scientific literature. Over 120 scientists, engineers, and physicians from universities, and government health agencies and industries reviewed the available body of research to develop the ANSI Standard (C95.1).\nThe design of Safety Connect complies with the FCC guidelines in addition to those standards.\n1-4.Theft deterrent system\nEngine immobilizer system\nThe vehicle’s keys have built-in transponder chips that prevent the engine from starting if a key has not been previously registered in the vehicle’s on-board computer.\nNever leave the keys inside the vehicle when you leave the vehicle.\nThis system is designed to help prevent vehicle theft but does not guarantee absolute security against all vehicle thefts.\nOperating the system\n\uf075 Vehicles without a smart key\nsystem\nThe indicator light flashes after the key has been removed from the engine switch to indicate that the system is operating.\nThe indicator light stops flashing after the registered key has\n1-4. Theft deterrent system\nbeen inserted into the engine switch to indicate that the system has been canceled.\n\uf075 Vehicles with a smart key sys-\ntem\nThe indicator light flashes after the engine switch has been turned off to indicate that the system is operating.\nThe indicator light stops flashing after the engine switch has been turned to ACC or ON to indicate that the system has been canceled.\nSystem maintenance The vehicle has a maintenance-free type engine immobilizer system. ■ Conditions that may cause the\nsystem to malfunction\nIf the grip portion of the key is in contact with a metallic object\nIf the key is in close proximity to or touching a key to the security system (key with a built-in transponder chip) of another vehicle\nNOTICE\nTo ensure the system oper-\nates correctly\nDo not modify or remove the system. If modified or removed, the proper operation of the system cannot be guaranteed.\n71\n1\nF o r\ns a f e t y\na n d\ns e c u r i t y\n72\n1-4. Theft deterrent system\nAlarm*\n: If equipped The alarm uses light and sound to give an alert when an intrusion is detected. The alarm is triggered in the following situations when the alarm is set: \uf06c A locked door is unlocked or opened in any way other than using the entry function or wireless remote control. (The doors will lock again automatically.)\n\uf06c The hood is opened.\nSetting/deactivating/stopping the alarm system\nItems to check before lock-\ning the vehicle\nTo prevent unexpected triggering of the alarm and vehicle theft, make sure of the following:\n\uf06c Nobody is in the vehicle.\n\uf06c The windows and moon roof\n(if equipped) are closed before the alarm is set.\n\uf06c No valuables or other personal items are left in the vehicle. ■ Setting\nClose the doors and hood, and lock all the doors. The system will set automatically after 30 seconds.\nThe indicator light changes from being on to flashing when the system is set.\nIf all doors are closed with back door or hood open, alarm system can be set.\nDeactivating or stopping\nDo one of the following to deactivate or stop the alarms:\n\uf06c Unlock the doors.\n\uf06c Turn the engine switch to ACC or ON, or start the engine. (The alarm will be deactivated or stopped after a few seconds.)\nSystem maintenance The vehicle has a maintenance-free type alarm system. ■ Triggering of the alarm The alarm may be triggered in the following situations: (Stopping the alarm deactivates the alarm system.) ● The doors are unlocked using the\nmechanical key.\nIf a door is unlocked using the mechanical key while the alarm is set, a warning will sound intermittently for approximately 10 seconds. If the alarm is not canceled or stopped during this time, the warning pattern changes and the warning sounds for a certain period of time. ● A person inside the vehicle opens a door or hood, or unlocks the vehicle using a door lock switch or inside lock button.\nThe battery is recharged or replaced when the vehicle is locked. (\uf0aeP.534)\nAlarm-operated door lock In the following cases, depending on the situation, the door may automatically lock to prevent improper entry into the vehicle: ● When a person remaining in the vehicle unlocks the door and the alarm is activated.\n1-4.

Vehicles with a smart key system: Press the engine switch to stop the engine.\n4 Slowly release the brake\npedal.\n5 Lock the door, making sure\nthat you have the key on your person.\nIf parking on a hill, block the wheels as needed. ■ Starting off on a steep\nuphill\n1 Make sure that the parking\nbrake is set and shift the shift lever to D.\n2 Gently depress the accelera-\ntor pedal.\n3 Release the parking brake.\nWhen starting off on a uphill The hill-start assist control will activate. ■ Driving in the rain ● Drive carefully when it is raining, because visibility will be reduced, the windows may become fogged-up, and the road will be slippery.\nDrive carefully when it starts to rain, because the road surface will be especially slippery.\nRefrain from high speeds when driving on an expressway in the rain, because there may be a layer of water between the tires and the road surface, preventing the steering and brakes from operating properly.\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n142\n4-1. Before driving\nEngine speed while driving In the following conditions, the engine speed may become high while driving. This is due to automatic up-shifting control or down-shifting implementation to meet driving conditions. It does not indicate sudden acceleration. ● The vehicle is judged to be driving\nuphill or downhill\nWhen the accelerator pedal is released\nRestraining the engine output\n(Brake Override System)\nWhen the accelerator and brake pedals are depressed at the same time, the engine output may be restrained.\nA warning message is displayed on the multi-information display while the system is operating. ■ Breaking in your new Toyota To extend the life of the vehicle, observing the following precautions is recommended: ● For the first 186 miles (300 km): Avoid sudden stops. ● For the first 500 miles (800 km): Do not tow a trailer. ● For the first 621 miles (1000 km): • Do not drive at extremely high speeds.\nAvoid sudden acceleration. • Do not drive continuously in low gears.\nDo not drive at a constant speed for extended periods.\nOperating your vehicle in a for-\neign country\nComply with the relevant vehicle registration laws and confirm the availability of the correct fuel. (\uf0aeP.544)\nWARNING\nObserve the following precautions. Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury. ■ When starting the vehicle Always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped with the engine running. This prevents the vehicle from creeping. ■ When driving the vehicle ● Do not drive if you are unfamiliar with the location of the brake and accelerator pedals to avoid depressing the wrong pedal. • Accidentally depressing the\naccelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal will result in sudden acceleration that may lead to an accident.\nWhen backing up, you may twist your body around, leading to a difficulty in operating the pedals. Make sure to operate the pedals properly.\nMake sure to keep a correct driving posture even when moving the vehicle only slightly. This allows you to depress the brake and accelerator pedals properly.\nDepress the brake pedal using your right foot. Depressing the brake pedal using your left foot may delay response in an emergency, resulting in an accident. ● Do not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials. The exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. These hot parts may cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby.\nWARNING\nDuring normal driving, do not turn off the engine. Turning the engine off while driving will not cause loss of steering or braking control, but the power assist to these systems will be lost. This will make it more difficult to steer and brake, so you should pull over and stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so. However, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible to stop the vehicle in the normal way: \uf0aeP.496\nUse engine braking (downshift) to maintain a safe speed when driving down a steep hill. Using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to overheat and lose effectiveness. (\uf0aeP.167)\nDo not adjust the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or outside rear view mirrors while driving. Doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control.\nAlways check that all passengers’ arms, heads or other parts of their body are not outside the vehicle.\nAWD models: Do not drive the vehicle off-road. This is not an AWD vehicle designed for off-road driving. Proceed with all due caution if it becomes unavoidable to drive off-road.\nAWD models: Do not drive across a river or through other bodies of water. This may cause electric/electronic components to short circuit, damage the engine or cause other serious damage to the vehicle.\n4-1. Before driving\nDo not drive in excess of the speed limit. Even if the legal speed limit permits it, do not drive over 85 mph (140 km/h) unless your vehicle has high-speed capability tires. Driving over 85 mph (140 km/h) may result in tire failure, loss of control and possible injury. Be sure to consult a tire dealer to determine whether the tires on your vehicle are high-speed capability tires or not before driving at such speeds. ■ When driving on slippery road surfaces\nSudden braking, acceleration and steering may cause tire slippage and reduce your ability to control the vehicle.\nSudden acceleration, engine braking due to shifting, or changes in engine speed could cause the vehicle to skid.\nAfter driving through a puddle, lightly depress the brake pedal to make sure that the brakes are functioning properly. Wet brake pads may prevent the brakes from functioning properly. If the brakes on only one side are wet and not functioning properly, steering control may be affected. ■ When shifting the shift lever ● Do not let the vehicle roll backward while a forward driving position is selected, or roll forward while the shift lever is in R. Doing so may cause the engine to stall or lead to poor brake and steering performance, resulting in an accident or damage to the vehicle.\n143\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n144\n4-1. Before driving\nWARNING\nDo not shift the shift lever to P while the vehicle is moving. Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.\nDo not shift the shift lever to R while the vehicle is moving forward. Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.\nDo not shift the shift lever to a driving position while the vehicle is moving backward. Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle control.\nMoving the shift lever to N while the vehicle is moving will disengage the engine from the transmission. Engine braking is not available when N is selected. ●Be careful not to shift the shift lever with the accelerator pedal depressed. Shifting the shift lever to any positions other than P or N may lead to unexpected rapid acceleration of the vehicle that may cause an accident and result in death or serious injury.\nIf you hear a squealing or scraping noise (brake pad wear indicators)\nHave the brake pads checked and replaced by your Toyota dealer as soon as possible.\nRotor damage may result if the pads are not replaced when needed.\nIt is dangerous to drive the vehicle when the wear limits of the brake pads and/or those of the brake discs are exceeded.\nWhen the vehicle is stopped ● Do not race the engine.\nIf the vehicle is in any gear other than P or N, the vehicle may accelerate suddenly and unexpectedly, causing an accident. ● In order to prevent accidents\ndue to the vehicle rolling away, always keep depressing the brake pedal while the engine is running, and apply the parking brake as necessary.\nIf the vehicle is stopped on an incline, in order to prevent accidents caused by the vehicle rolling forward or backward, always depress the brake pedal and securely apply the parking brake as needed.\nAvoid revving or racing the engine. Running the engine at high speed while the vehicle is stopped may cause the exhaust system to overheat, which could result in a fire if combustible material is nearby.\nWhen the vehicle is parked ● Do not leave glasses, cigarette lighters, spray cans, or soft drink cans in the vehicle when it is in the sun. Doing so may result in the following:\nGas may leak from a cigarette lighter or spray can, and may lead to a fire.\nThe temperature inside the vehicle may cause the plastic lenses and plastic material of glasses to deform or crack.\nSoft drink cans may fracture, causing the contents to spray over the interior of the vehicle, and may also cause a short circuit in the vehicle’s electrical components.\nWARNING\nDo not leave cigarette lighters in the vehicle. If a cigarette lighter is in a place such as the glove box or on the floor, it may be lit accidentally when luggage is loaded or the seat is adjusted, causing a fire.\nDo not attach adhesive discs to the windshield or windows. Do not place containers such as air fresheners on the instrument panel or dashboard. Adhesive discs or containers may act as lenses, causing a fire in the vehicle.\nDo not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a metallized film such as a silver-colored one. Reflected sunlight may cause the glass to act as a lens, causing a fire.\nAlways apply the parking brake, shift the shift lever to P, stop the engine and lock the vehicle. Do not leave the vehicle unattended while the engine is running. If the vehicle is parked with the shift lever in P but the parking brake is not set, the vehicle may start to move, possibly leading to an accident.\nDo not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately after turning the engine off. Doing so may cause burns.\n4-1. Before driving\nWhen taking a nap in the vehi-\ncle\nAlways turn the engine off. Otherwise, if you accidentally move the shift lever or depress the accelerator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire due to engine overheating. Additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly ventilated area, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle, leading to death or a serious health hazard. ■ When braking ● When the brakes are wet, drive\nmore cautiously. Braking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause one side of the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. Also, the parking brake may not securely hold the vehicle.\nIf the brake booster device does not operate, do not follow other vehicles closely and avoid hills or sharp turns that require braking. In this case, braking is still possible, but the brake pedal should be depressed more firmly than usual. Also, the braking distance will increase. Have your brakes fixed immediately. ● Do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. Each push on the brake pedal uses up the reserve for the power-assisted brakes.\nThe brake system consists of 2 individual hydraulic systems; if one of the systems fails, the other will still operate. In this case, the brake pedal should be depressed more firmly than usual and the braking distance will increase. Have your brakes fixed immediately.\n145\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n146\n4-1. Before driving\nWARNING\nIf the vehicle becomes stuck Do not spin the wheels excessively when a driven wheel is up in the air, or the vehicle is stuck in sand, mud, etc. This may damage the driveline components or propel the vehicle forward or backward, causing an accident.\nNOTICE\nWhen driving the vehicle ●Do not depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time during driving, as this may restrain the engine output. ●Do not use the accelerator\npedal or depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time to hold the vehicle on a hill.\nWhen parking the vehicle Always set the parking brake and shift the shift lever to P. Failure to do so may cause the vehicle to move or the vehicle may accelerate suddenly if the accelerator pedal is accidentally depressed. ■ Avoiding damage to vehicle\nparts\nDo not turn the steering wheel fully in either direction and hold it there for an extended period of time. Doing so may damage the power steering motor.\nWhen driving over bumps in the road, drive as slowly as possible to avoid damaging the wheels, underside of the vehicle, etc.\nIf you get a flat tire while driv-\ning\nA flat or damaged tire may cause the following situations. Hold the steering wheel firmly and gradually depress the brake pedal to slow down the vehicle. ● It may be difficult to control your\nvehicle.\nThe vehicle will make abnormal sounds or vibrations.\nThe vehicle will lean abnormally.\nInformation on what to do in case of a flat tire (\uf0aeP.518) ■ When encountering flooded\nroads\nDo not drive on a road that has flooded after heavy rain etc. Doing so may cause the following serious damage to the vehicle: ● Engine stalling ● Short in electrical components ● Engine damage caused by\nwater immersion\nIn the event that you drive on a flooded road and the vehicle becomes flooded or stuck in mud or sand, be sure to have your Toyota dealer check the following: ● Brake function ● Changes in the quantity and quality of the engine oil, transaxle fluid, transfer oil (AWD models), rear differential oil (AWD models), etc.\nLubricant condition for the propeller shaft (AWD models), bearings and suspension joints (where possible), and the function of all joints, bearings, etc.\nSudden start restraint control (Drive-Start Control [DSC])\nWhen the following unusual operation is performed with the accelerator pedal depressed, the engine output may be restrained.\n\uf06c When the shift lever is shifted\nto R*.\n\uf06c When the shift lever is shifted from P or R to forward drive shift positon such as D*.\nWhen the system operates, a message appears on the multi-information display. Read the message and follow the instruction. *: Depending on the situation, the\nshift position may not be changed.\nDrive-Start Control (DSC) When the TRAC is turned off (\uf0aeP.270), sudden start restraint control also does not operate. If your vehicle have trouble escaping from the mud or fresh snow due to sudden start restraint control operation, deactivate TRAC (\uf0aeP.270) so that the vehicle may become able to escape from the mud or fresh snow.\n4-1. Before driving\n147\nCargo and luggage\nTake notice of the following information about storage precautions, cargo capacity and load:\nCapacity and distribution\nCargo capacity depends on the total weight of the occupants.\n(Cargo capacity) = (Total load capacity) — (Total weight of occupants)\nSteps for Determining Correct Load Limit —\n(1) Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle’s placard.\n(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that will be riding in your vehicle.\n(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from XXX kg or XXX lbs.\n(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.\nFor example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400 −\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n148\n4-1. Before driving\n750 (5 \uf0b4 150) = 650 lbs.)\n(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4.\n(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your vehicle. (\uf0aeP.150)\nCalculation formula for your vehicle\nCargo capacity\nTotal load capacity (vehicle capacity weight) (\uf0aeP.542)\nWhen 2 people with the combined weight of A lb. (kg) are riding in your vehicle, which has a total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight) of B lb. (kg), the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity will\nbe C lb. (kg) as follows: B*2 lb. (kg) A*1 lb. (kg) = C*3 lb. (kg) *1: A =Weight of people *2: B =Total load capacity *3: C =Available cargo and luggage\nload\nIn this condition, if 3 more passengers with the combined weight of D lb. (kg) get on, the available cargo and luggage load will be reduced E lb. (kg) as follows: C lb. (kg) D*4 lb. (kg) = E*5 lb. (kg) *4: D =Additional weight of people *5: E =Available cargo and luggage\nload\nAs shown in the example above, if the number of occupants increases, the cargo and luggage load will be reduced by an amount that equals the increased weight due to the additional occupants. In other words, if an increase in the number of occupants causes an excess of the total load capacity (combined weight of occupants plus cargo and luggage load), you must reduce the cargo and luggage on your vehicle.\nWARNING\nThings that must not be carried in the luggage compartment\nThe following things may cause a fire if loaded in the luggage compartment:\nWARNING\nReceptacles containing gasoline\nAerosol cans ■ Storage precautions Observe the following precautions. Failure to do so may prevent the pedals from being depressed properly, may block the driver’s vision, or may result in items hitting the driver or passengers, possibly causing an accident. ●Stow cargo and luggage in the luggage compartment whenever possible.\nDo not stack cargo and luggage in the luggage compartment higher than the seatbacks. ●When you fold down the rear seats, long items should not be placed directly behind the front seats.\nNever allow anyone to ride in the luggage compartment. It is not designed for passengers. They should ride in their seats with their seat belts properly fastened.\nDo not place cargo or luggage in or on the following locations.\nAt the feet of the driver\nOn the front passenger or rear seats (when stacking items)\nOn the luggage cover\nOn the instrument panel\nOn the dashboard ●Secure all items in the occupant compartment.\n4-1. Before driving\nCapacity and distribution ● Do not exceed the maximum axle weight rating or the total vehicle weight rating.\nEven if the total load of occupant’s weight and the cargo load is less than the total load capacity, do not apply the load unevenly. Improper loading may cause deterioration of steering or braking control which may cause death or serious injury. ■ When using a roof luggage carrier (vehicles with roof rails) Observe the following precautions: ● Place the cargo so that its weight is distributed evenly between the front and rear axles.\nIf loading long or wide cargo, never exceed the vehicle overall length or width. (\uf0aeP.542) ● Before driving, make sure the cargo is securely fastened on the roof luggage carrier.\nLoading cargo on the roof luggage carrier will make the center of gravity of the vehicle higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking or abrupt maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover due to failure to operate this vehicle correctly and result in death or serious injury.\nIf driving for a long distance, on rough roads, or at high speeds, stop the vehicle now and then during the trip to make sure the cargo remains in its place. ● Do not exceed 165 lb. (75 kg) cargo weight on the roof luggage carrier.\n149\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n150\n4-1. Before driving\nNOTICE\nWhen loading cargo (vehicles with a moon roof)\nBe careful not to scratch the surface of the moon roof.\nVehicle load limits\nVehicle load limits include total load capacity, seating capacity, towing capacity and cargo capacity.\n\uf06c Total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight): \uf0aeP.542\nTotal load capacity means the combined weight of occupants, cargo and luggage. \uf06c Seating capacity: \uf0aeP.542\nSeating capacity means the maximum number of occupants whose estimated average weight is 150 lb. (68 kg) per person. \uf06c TWR (Trailer Weight Rat-\ning): \uf0aeP.156, 542\nTWR means the maximum gross trailer weight (trailer weight plus its cargo weight) that your vehicle is able to tow. \uf06c Cargo capacity\nCargo capacity may increase or decrease depending on the weight and the number of occupants.\nTotal load capacity and seating\ncapacity\nThese details are also described on the tire and loading information label. (\uf0aeP.478)\nWARNING\nOverloading the vehicle Do not overload the vehicle. It may not only cause damage to the tires, but also degrade steering and braking ability, resulting in an accident.\n4-1. Before driving\nTrailer towing\nYour vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load-carrying vehicle. Towing a trailer can have an adverse impact on handling, performance, braking, durability, and fuel consumption. For your safety and the safety of others, you must not overload your vehicle or trailer. You must also ensure that you are using appropriate towing equipment, that the towing equipment has been installed correctly and used properly, and that you employ the requisite driving habits.\nVehicle-trailer stability and braking performance are affected by trailer stability, brake performance and setting, trailer brakes, the hitch and hitch systems (if equipped).\nTo tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in accordance with your trailer’s characteristics and operating conditions.\n151\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n152\n4-1. Before driving\nToyota warranties do not apply to damage or malfunction caused by towing a trailer for commercial purposes.\nContact your Toyota dealer for further information about additional requirements such as a towing kit, etc.\nMatching trailer ball height to\ntrailer coupler height\nNo matter which class of tow hitch applies, for a more safe trailer hookup, the trailer ball setup must be the proper height for the coupler on the trailer.\nCoupler\nTrailer ball ■ Before towing Check that the following conditions are met: ● Ensure that your vehicle’s tires are properly inflated. (\uf0aeP.548) ● Trailer tires are inflated according to the trailer manufacturer’s recommendation.\nAll trailer lights work as required by law.\nAll lights work each time you connect them.\nThe trailer ball is set at the proper height for the coupler on the trailer.\nThe trailer is level when it is hitched. Do not drive if the trailer is not level, and check for improper tongue weight, overloading, worn suspension, or other possible causes.\nThe trailer cargo is securely loaded.\nThe rear view mirrors conform to all applicable federal, state/provincial or local regulations. If they do not, install rear view mirrors appropriate for towing purposes. ■ Break-in schedule If your vehicle is new or equipped with any new power train components (such as an engine, transaxle, transfer [AWD models], rear differential [AWD models] or wheel bearing), Toyota recommends that you do not tow a trailer until the vehicle has been driven for over 500 miles (800 km). After the vehicle has been driven for over 500 miles (800 km), you can start towing. However, for the next 500 miles (800 km), drive the vehicle at a speed of less than 50 mph (80 km/h) when towing a trailer, and avoid full throttle acceleration. ■ Maintenance ● If you tow a trailer, your vehicle\nwill require more frequent maintenance due to the additional load. (See “Scheduled Maintenance Guide” or “Owner’s Manual Supplement”.)\nRetighten the fixing bolts of the towing ball and bracket after approximately 600 miles (1000 km) of trailer towing.\nIf trailer sway occurs One or more factors (crosswinds, passing vehicles, rough roads, etc.) can adversely affect handling of your vehicle and trailer, causing instability. ● If trailer swaying occurs: • Firmly grip the steering wheel.\nSteer straight ahead. Do not try to control trailer swaying by turning the steering wheel.\nBegin releasing the accelerator pedal immediately but very gradually to reduce speed. Do not increase speed. Do not apply vehicle brakes.\nIf you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, your vehicle and trailer should stabilize. (if enabled, Trailer Sway Control can also help to stabilize the vehicle and trailer.) ● After the trailer swaying has\nstopped:\nStop in a safe place. Get all occupants out of the vehicle.\nCheck the tires of the vehicle and the trailer.\nCheck the load in the trailer. Make sure the load has not shifted. Make sure the tongue weight is appropriate, if possible.\nCheck the load in the vehicle. Make sure the vehicle is not overloaded after occupants get in.\nIf you cannot find any problems, the speed at which trailer swaying occurred is beyond the limit of your particular vehicle-trailer combination. Drive at a lower speed to prevent instability. Remember that swaying of the towing vehicle-trailer increases as speed increases.\n4-1. Before driving\nWARNING\nTrailer towing precautions To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in accordance with the trailer’s characteristics and operating conditions. Failure to do so could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. Vehicle stability and braking performance are affected by trailer stability, brake setting and performance, and the hitch. Your vehicle will handle differently when towing a trailer. ■ To avoid accident or injury ● Do not exceed the TWR,\nunbraked TWR, GCWR, GVWR or GAWR.\nAdjust the tongue weight within the appropriate range. Place heavier loads as close to the trailer axle as possible.\nDo not exceed 65 mph (104 km/h), the posted towing speed limit or the speed limit for your trailer as set forth in your trailer owner’s manual, whichever is lowest. Slow down sufficiently before making a turn, in cross winds, on wet or slippery surface, etc. to help avoid an accident. If you experience a vehicle-trailer instability from reducing a certain speed, slow down and make sure you keep your vehicle speed under the speed of which you experience the instability.\nDo not make jerky, abrupt or sharp turns.\nDo not apply the brakes suddenly as you may skid, resulting in jackknifing and loss of vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or slippery surfaces.\n153\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n154\n4-1. Before driving\nWARNING\nDo not exceed the trailer hitch assembly weight, gross vehicle weight, gross axle weight and trailer tongue weight capacities.\nDo not use the following systems when trailer towing.\nDynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range\nLTA (Lane Tracing Assist)\nPCS (Pre-Collision System)\nBSM (Blind Spot Monitor) (if equipped)\nSlow down and downshift\nbefore descending steep or long downhill grades. Do not make sudden downshifts while descending steep or long downhill grades.\nVehicle-trailer instability is more likely on steep long downhills. Before descending steep or long downhill grades, slow down and downshift. Do not make sudden downshifts when descending steep or long downhill grades. Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or applying the brakes too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result in reduced braking efficiency. ●Do not tow a trailer when the compact spare tire is installed on your vehicle. ■ When towing a trailer Toyota recommends trailers with brakes that conform to any applicable federal and state/provincial regulations.\nIf the gross trailer weight\nexceeds unbraked TWR, trailer brakes are required. Toyota recommends trailers with brakes that conform to all applicable federal and state/provincial regulations.\nNever tap into your vehicle’s hydraulic system, as this will lower the vehicle’s braking effectiveness.\nNever tow a trailer without using a safety chain securely attached to both the trailer and the vehicle. If damage occurs to the coupling unit or hitch ball, there is danger of the trailer wandering into another lane.

Toyota recommends the use of Toyota hitch/bracket for your vehicle. For details, contact your Toyota dealer. \uf06c If you wish to install a trailer hitch, contact your Toyota dealer.\n\uf06c Use only a hitch that conforms to the gross trailer weight requirement of your vehicle.\n4-1. Before driving\n157\n\uf06c Follow the directions supplied by the hitch manufacturer. \uf06c Lubricate the hitch ball with a\nlight coating of grease.\n\uf06c Remove the hitch ball whenever you are not towing a trailer. Remove the trailer hitch if you do not need it. After removing the hitch, seal any mounting hole in the vehicle body to prevent entry of any substances into the vehicle.\nWARNING\nHitch Trailer hitch assemblies have different weight capacities established by the hitch manufacturer. Even though the vehicle may be physically capable of towing a higher weight, the operator must determine the maximum weight rating of the particular hitch assembly and never exceed the maximum weight rating specified for the trailer-hitch. Exceeding the maximum weight rating set by the trailer-hitch manufacturer can cause an accident resulting in death or serious personal injuries.\nNOTICE\nWhen installing a trailer hitch Use only the position recommended by your Toyota dealer. Do not install the trailer hitch on the bumper; this may cause body damage.\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n158\n4-1.

Please take care to comply with your state's laws when installing trailer lights.\nNOTICE\nDo not directly splice trailer\nlights\nDo not directly splice trailer lights. Directly splicing trailer lights may damage your vehicle’s electrical system and cause a malfunction.\nTrailer towing tips\nYour vehicle will handle differently when towing a trailer. Help to avoid an accident, death or serious injury, keep the following\nin mind when towing: \uf06c Speed limits for towing a\ntrailer vary by state or province. Do not exceed the posted towing speed limit. \uf06c Toyota recommends that the vehicle-trailer speed limit is 65 mph (104 km/h) on a flat, straight, dry road. Do not exceed this limit, the posted towing speed limit or the speed limit for your trailer as set forth in your trailer owner’s manual, whichever is lowest. Instability of the towing vehicle-trailer combination (trailer sway) increases as speed increases. Exceeding speed limits may cause loss of control.\n\uf06c Before starting out, check the trailer lights, tires and the vehicle-trailer connections. Recheck after driving a short distance.\n\uf06c Practice turning, stopping and\nreversing with the trailer attached in an area away from traffic until you become accustomed to the feel of the vehicle-trailer combination.\n\uf06c Reversing with a trailer attached is difficult and requires practice. Grip the bottom of the steering wheel and move your hand to the left to move the trailer to the left. Move your hand to the right to move the trailer to\nright. (This is generally opposite to reversing without a trailer attached.) Avoid sharp or prolonged turning. Have someone guide you when reversing to reduce the risk of an accident.\n\uf06c As stopping distance is\nincreased when towing a trailer, vehicle-to vehicle distance should be increased. For each 10 mph (16 km/h) of speed, allow at least one vehicle and trailer length.\n\uf06c Avoid sudden braking as you may skid, resulting in the trailer jackknifing and a loss of vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or slippery surfaces.\n\uf06c Avoid jerky starts or sudden\nacceleration.\n\uf06c Avoid jerky steering and\nsharp turns, and slow down before making turn.\n\uf06c Note that when making a turn,\nthe trailer wheels will be closer than the vehicle wheels to the inside of the turn. Compensate by making a wider than normal turning radius.\n\uf06c Slow down before making a\nturn, in cross winds, on wet or slippery surfaces, etc. Increasing vehicle speed can destabilize the trailer.\n\uf06c Take care when passing other vehicles. Passing requires\n4-1. Before driving\n159\nconsiderable distance. After passing a vehicle, do not forget the length of your trailer, and be sure you have plenty of room before changing lanes.\n\uf06c To maintain engine braking efficiency and charging system performance when using engine braking, do not put the transmission in D. If in the M mode, the transmission shift range position must be in 6 or lower. (\uf0aeP.167)\n\uf06c Instability happens more frequently when descending steep or long downhill grades. Before descending, slow down and downshift. Do not make sudden downshifts while descending steep or long downhill grades.\n\uf06c Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or applying the brakes too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result in reduced braking efficiency.\n\uf06c Due to the added load of the trailer, your vehicle’s engine may overheat on hot days (at temperatures over 85°F [30°C]) when driving up a long or steep grade. If the engine coolant temperature gauge indicates overheating, immediately turn off the air conditioning (if in use), pull your vehicle off the road and stop\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n160\n4-1. Before driving\nin a safe spot. (\uf0aeP.536)\n\uf06c Always place wheel blocks\nunder both the vehicle’s and the trailer’s wheels when parking. Put the transmission in P and apply the parking brake. Avoid parking on a slope, but if unavoidable, do so only after performing the following:\n1 Apply the brakes and keep\nthem applied.\n2 Have someone place wheel blocks under both the vehicle’s and trailer’s wheels.\n3 When the wheel blocks are in place, release the brakes slowly until the blocks absorb the load.\n4 Shift into P and apply the\nparking brake.\n5 Turn off the engine. \uf06c When restarting after parking\non a slope:\n1 With the transmission in P, start the engine. Be sure to keep the brake pedal depressed.\n2 Shift into a forward gear. If reversing, shift into R.\n3 If the parking brake is in manual mode, release the parking brake.

Using the driving support systems\n195\nPCS (Pre-Collision System)\nSystem functions\nPre-collision warning\nThe pre-collision system uses a radar sensor and front camera to detect objects (\uf0aeP.198) in front of the vehicle. When the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with an object is high, a warning operates to urge the driver to take evasive action and the potential brake pressure is increased to help the driver avoid the collision. If the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with an object is extremely high, the brakes are automatically applied to help avoid the collision or help reduce the impact of the collision.\nThe pre-collision system can be disabled/enabled and the warning timing can be changed. (\uf0aeP.197)\nDetectable objects\nThe system can detect the following:\nWhen the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is high, a buzzer will sound and a warning message will be displayed on the multi-information display to urge the driver to take evasive action.\nPre-collision brake assist\nWhen the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is high, the system applies greater braking force in relation to how strongly the brake pedal is depressed. ■ Pre-collision braking\nIf the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is extremely high, the brakes are automatically applied to help avoid the collision or reduce the impact of the collision.\n\uf06c Vehicles\n\uf06c Bicyclists\n\uf06c Pedestrians\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n196\n4-5. Using the driving support systems\nWARNING\nLimitations of the pre-colli-\nsion system\nThe driver is solely responsible for safe driving. Always drive safely, taking care to observe your surroundings. Do not use the pre-collision system instead of normal braking operations under any circumstances. This system will not prevent collisions or lessen collision damage or injury in every situation. Do not overly rely on this system. Failure to do so may lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.\nAlthough this system is\ndesigned to help avoid a collision or help reduce the impact of the collision, its effectiveness may change according to various conditions, therefore the system may not always be able to achieve the same level of performance. Read the following conditions carefully. Do not overly rely on this system and always drive carefully.\nConditions under which the system may operate even if there is no possibility of a collision: \uf0aeP.199\nPre-collision braking ● When the pre-collision braking function is operating, a large amount of braking force will be applied.\nIf the vehicle is stopped by the operation of the pre-collision braking function, the pre-collision braking function operation will be canceled after approximately 2 seconds. Depress the brake pedal as necessary. ● The pre-collision braking function may not operate if certain operations are performed by the driver. If the accelerator pedal is being depressed strongly or the steering wheel is being turned, the system may determine that the driver is taking evasive action and possibly prevent the pre-collision braking function from operating.\nIn some situations, while the pre-collision braking function is operating, operation of the function may be canceled if the accelerator pedal is depressed strongly or the steering wheel is turned and the system determines that the driver is taking evasive action.\nIf the brake pedal is being\nConditions under which the system may not operate properly: \uf0aeP.200\nDo not attempt to test the operation of the pre-collision system yourself.

Do not rely solely on the system, and drive safely by always paying careful attention to your surroundings.\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range provides driving assistance to reduce the driver’s burden. However, there are limitations to the assistance provided. Read the following conditions carefully. Do not overly rely on this system and always drive carefully. • When the sensor may not be correctly detecting the vehicle ahead: \uf0aeP.225\nSwitch the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range setting to off, using the cruise control main switch when not in use. ■ Cautions regarding the driv-\ning assist systems\nObserve the following precautions, as there are limitations to the assistance provided by the system.

Using the driving support systems\nWARNING\nAssisting the driver to measure following distance\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is only intended to help the driver in determining the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mechanism that allows careless or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings. ●Assisting the driver to judge proper following distance\nSituations unsuitable for\ndynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range\nDo not use dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range in any of the following situations. Doing so may result in inappropriate speed control and could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. ● Roads where there are pedes-\ntrians, cyclists, etc.\nIn heavy traffic ● On roads with sharp bends ● On winding roads ● On slippery roads, such as those covered with rain, ice or snow\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range determines whether the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling ahead is within a set range. It is not capable of making any other type of judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in any given situation. ●Assisting the driver to operate\nthe vehicle\nThe dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range does not include functions which will prevent or avoid collisions with vehicles ahead of your vehicle. Therefore, if there is ever any possibility of danger, the driver must take immediate and direct control of the vehicle and act appropriately in order to ensure the safety of all involved.\nOn steep downhills, or where there are sudden changes between sharp up and down gradients Vehicle speed may exceed the set speed when driving down a steep hill. ● At entrances to freeways and\nhighways\nWhen weather conditions are bad enough that they may prevent the sensors from detecting correctly (fog, snow, sandstorm, heavy rain, etc.)\nWhen there is rain, snow, etc. on the front surface of the radar or front camera\nIn traffic conditions that require frequent repeated acceleration and deceleration\nWhen your vehicle is towing a trailer or during emergency towing\nWhen an approach warning buzzer is heard often\n4-5. Using the driving support systems\nDriving in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode\nThis mode employs a radar to detect the presence of vehicles up to approximately 328 ft. (100 m) ahead, determines the current vehicle-to-vehicle following distance, and operates to maintain a suitable following distance from the vehicle ahead. The desired vehicle-to-vehicle distance can also be set by operating the vehicle-to-vehicle distance switch.\nWhen driving on downhill slopes, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance may become shorter.\nExample of constant speed cruising When there are no vehicles ahead\nThe vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver.\nExample of deceleration cruising and follow-up cruising When a preceding vehicle driving slower than the set speed appears\nWhen a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically decelerates your vehicle. When a greater reduction in vehicle speed is necessary, the system applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at this time). The system will respond to changes in the speed of the vehicle ahead in order to maintain the vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver. Approach warning warns you when the system cannot decelerate sufficiently to prevent your vehicle from closing in on the vehicle ahead. When the vehicle ahead of you stops, your vehicle will also stop (vehicle is stopped by system control). After the vehicle ahead starts off, pressing the “+RES” switch or depressing the accelerator pedal (start-off operation) will resume follow-up cruising. If the start-off operation is not performed, system control continues to keep your vehicle stopped.\n219\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n220\n4-5. Using the driving support systems\nWhen the turn signal lever is operated and your vehicle moves to an overtaking lane while driving at 50 mph (80 km/h) or more, the vehicle will accelerate to help to overtake a passing vehicle. The system’s identification of what is an overtaking lane may be determined solely based on the location of the steering wheel in the vehicle (left side driver position versus right side driver position.) If the vehicle is driven to a region where the overtaking lane is on a different side from where the vehicle is normally driven, the vehicle may accelerate when the turn signal lever is operated in the opposite direction to the overtaking lane (e.g., if the driver normally operates the vehicle in a region where the overtaking lane is to the right but then drives to a region where the overtaking lane is to the left, the vehicle may accelerate when the right turn signal is activated).\nExample of acceleration When there are no longer any preceding vehicles driving slower than the set speed\nThe system accelerates until the set speed is reached.

Driving tips\n4-6.Driving tips\nWinter driving tips\nCarry out the necessary preparations and inspections before driving the vehicle in winter. Always drive the vehicle in a manner appropriate to the prevailing weather conditions.\nPre-winter preparations\n\uf06c Use fluids that are appropriate to the prevailing outside temperatures.\nEngine oil\nEngine coolant\nWasher fluid \uf06c Have a service technician inspect the condition of the battery. \uf06c Have the vehicle fitted with\nfour snow tires.\nEnsure that all tires are the same size and brand.\nWARNING\nDriving with snow tires Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of accidents. Failure to do so may result in a loss of vehicle control and cause death or serious injury. ●Use tires of the size specified. ●Maintain the recommended\nlevel of air pressure.\nDo not drive in excess of 75 mph (120 km/h), regardless of the type of snow tires being used.\nUse snow tires on all, not just some wheels.\nNOTICE\nDriving with tire chains Do not fit tire chains. Tire chains may damage the vehicle body and suspension, and adversely affect driving performance. ■ Repairing or replacing snow\ntires\nRequest repairs or replacement of snow tires from Toyota dealers or legitimate tire retailers. This is because the removal and attachment of snow tires affects the operation of the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters.\nBefore driving the vehicle\nPerform the following according to the driving conditions: \uf06c Do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen. Pour warm water over the frozen area to melt the ice. Wipe away the water immediately to prevent it from freezing.\n\uf06c To ensure proper operation of the climate control system fan, remove any snow that has accumulated on the air inlet vents in front of the windshield.\n\uf06c Check for and remove any\nexcess ice or snow that may have accumulated on the exterior lights, vehicle’s roof, chassis, around the tires or on the brakes.\n\uf06c Remove any snow or mud\nfrom the bottom of your shoes before getting in the vehicle.\nWhen driving the vehicle\nAccelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suitable to road conditions.\nWhen parking the vehicle\n\uf06c Park the vehicle and shift the shift lever to P without setting the parking brake. The parking brake may freeze up, preventing it from being released. If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, make sure to block the wheels. Failure to do so may be dangerous because it may cause the vehicle to move unexpectedly, possibly leading to an accident.\n\uf06c If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, confirm that the shift lever cannot be moved out of P*. *: The shift lever will be locked if it is attempted to be shifted from P to\n4-6. Driving tips\n275\nany other position without depressing the brake pedal. If the shift lever can be shifted from P, there may be a problem with the shift lock system. Have the vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer immediately.\nSelecting tire chains\nTire chains cannot be mounted. Snow tires should be used instead.\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n276\n4-6. Driving tips\nUtility vehicle precautions\nThis vehicle belongs to the utility vehicle class, which has higher ground clearance and narrower tread in relation to the height of its center of gravity.\nUtility vehicle feature\n\uf06c Specific design characteristics give it a higher center of gravity than ordinary passenger cars. This vehicle design feature causes this type of vehicle to be more likely to rollover. And, utility vehicles have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.\n\uf06c An advantage of the higher ground clearance is a better view of the road allowing you to anticipate problems.\n\uf06c It is not designed for cornering at the same speeds as ordinary passenger cars any more than low-slung sports cars are designed to perform satisfactorily under off-road conditions. Therefore, sharp turns at excessive speeds may cause the vehicle to rollover.\nWARNING\nUtility vehicle precautions Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death, serious injury or damage to your vehicle: ● In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing a seat belt. Therefore, the driver and all passengers should always fasten their seat belts.\nAvoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers, if at all possible. Failure to operate this vehicle correctly may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover causing death or serious injury. ● Loading cargo on the roof luggage carrier (if equipped) will make the center of the vehicle gravity higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden braking or abrupt maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or vehicle rollover due to failure to operate this vehicle correctly.\nAlways slow down in gusty crosswinds. Because of its profile and higher center of gravity, your vehicle is more sensitive to side winds than an ordinary passenger car. Slowing down will allow you to have better control.\nDo not drive horizontally across steep slopes. Driving straight up or straight down is preferred. Your vehicle (or any similar off-road vehicle) can tip over sideways much more easily than forward or backward.\nOff-road driving\nWhen driving your vehicle off-road, please observe the following precautions to ensure your driving enjoyment and to help prevent the closure of areas to off-road vehicles: \uf06c Drive your vehicle only in\nareas where off-road vehicles are permitted to travel.\n\uf06c Respect private property. Get owner’s permission before entering private property. \uf06c Do not enter areas that are\nclosed. Honor gates, barriers and signs that restrict travel. \uf06c Stay on established roads. When conditions are wet, driving techniques should be changed or travel delayed to prevent damage to roads.\nAdditional information for\noff-road driving\n\uf075 For owners in U.S. mainland,\nHawaii and Puerto Rico:\nTo obtain additional information pertaining to driving your vehicle off-road, consult the following organizations. ● State and Local Parks and Recre-\nation Departments\nState Motor Vehicle Bureau ● Recreational Vehicle Clubs ● U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management\n4-6. Driving tips\nWARNING\nOff-road driving precautions Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death, serious injury or damage to your vehicle: ● Drive carefully when off the\nroad. Do not take unnecessary risks by driving in dangerous places.\nDo not grip the steering wheel spokes when driving off-road. A bad bump could jerk the wheel and injure your hands. Keep both hands and especially your thumbs on the outside of the rim.\nAlways check your brakes for effectiveness immediately after driving in sand, mud, water or snow.\nAfter driving through tall grass, mud, rock, sand, rivers, etc., check that there is no grass, bush, paper, rags, stone, sand, etc. adhering or trapped on the underbody. Clear off any such matter from the underbody. If the vehicle is used with these materials trapped or adhering to the underbody, a breakdown or fire could occur.\nWhen driving off-road or in rugged terrain, do not drive at excessive speeds, jump, make sharp turns, strike objects, etc. This may cause loss of control or vehicle rollover causing death or serious injury. You are also risking expensive damage to your vehicle’s suspension and chassis.\n277\n4\nD\nr i v n g\ni\n278\n4-6. Driving tips\nNOTICE\nTo prevent water damage Take all necessary safety measures to ensure that water damage to the engine or other components does not occur. ●Water entering the engine air\nintake will cause severe engine damage.\nWater entering the continuously variable transmission will cause deterioration in shift quality, locking up of your transmission accompanied by vibration, and ultimately damage.\nWater can wash the grease from wheel bearings, causing rusting and premature failure, and may also enter the differentials, transmission and transfer (AWD models) case, reducing the gear oil’s lubricating qualities.\nWhen you drive through\nwater\nIf driving through water, such as when crossing shallow streams, first check the depth of the water and the bottom of the riverbed for firmness. Drive slowly and avoid deep water. ■ Inspection after off-road driv-\ning\nSand and mud that has accumulated around brake discs may affect braking efficiency and may damage brake system components.\nAlways perform a maintenance inspection after each day of off-road driving that has taken you through rough terrain, sand, mud, or water. For scheduled maintenance information, refer to the “Scheduled Maintenance Guide” or “Owner’s Manual Supplement”.\nAudio\n.5-1.

Tips for operating the audio/visual system\n5-10.Tips for operating the audio/visual system\nOperating information\nThe use of a cellular phone inside or near the vehicle may cause a noise from the speakers of the audio/visual system which you are listening to. However, this does not indicate a malfunction.\nFM is about 25 miles (40 km). Once outside this range, you may notice fading and drifting, which increase with the distance from the radio transmitter. They are often accompanied by distortion.\nNOTICE\nTo avoid damage to the audio/visual system: Be careful not to spill beverages over the audio/visual system.\nMulti-path: FM signals are reflective, making it possible for 2 signals to reach the vehicle’s antenna at the same time. If this happens, the signals will cancel each other out, causing a momentary flutter or loss of reception.\nRadio\nUsually, a problem with radio reception does not mean there is a problem with the radio \uf0be it is just the normal result of conditions outside the vehicle.\nStatic and fluttering: These occur when signals are blocked by buildings, trees or other large objects. Increasing the bass level may reduce static and fluttering.\nFor example, nearby buildings and terrain can interfere with FM reception. Power lines or phone wires can interfere with AM signals. And of course, radio signals have a limited range. The farther the vehicle is from a station, the weaker its signal will be. In addition, reception conditions change constantly as the vehicle moves.\nHere are some common reception problems that may not indicate a problem with the radio as described. ■ FM Fading and drifting stations: Generally, the effective range of\nStation swapping: If the FM signal being listened to is interrupted or weakened, and there is another strong station nearby on the FM band, the radio may tune in the second station until the original signal can be picked up again. ■ AM Fading: AM broadcasts are reflected by the upper atmosphere \uf0be especially at night. These reflected signals can interfere with those received directly from the radio station, causing the radio station to sound alternately strong and weak.\n5-10. Tips for operating the audio/visual system\n351\nStation interference: When a reflected signal and a signal received directly from a radio station are very nearly the same frequency, they can interfere with each other, making it difficult to hear the broadcast.\niPhone 5c • iPhone 5 • iPod touch (6th generation) • iPod touch (5th generation)\nThis system only supports audio playback.\nStatic: AM is easily affected by external sources of electrical noise, such as high tension power lines, lightening or electrical motors. This results in static. ■ SiriusXM\nDepending on difference between models or software versions etc., some models might be incompatible with this system.\nHigh-resolution sound source\n\uf06c Cargo loaded on the roof luggage carrier, especially metal objects, may adversely affect the reception of SiriusXM Satellite Radio.\n\uf06c Alternation or modifications carried out without appropriate authorization may invalidate the user’s right to operate the equipment.\nThis device supports high-resolution sound sources.\nThe definition of high-resolution is based on the standards of groups such as the CTA (Consumer Technology Association).\nSupported formats and playable media are as follows. ■ Supported formats\niPod\nWAV, FLAC, ALAC, OGG Vorbis ■ Playable media\nCompatible models\nUSB memory\nMade for • iPhone X • iPhone 8 • iPhone 8 Plus • iPhone 7 • iPhone 7 Plus • iPhone SE • iPhone 6s • iPhone 6s Plus • iPhone 6 • iPhone 6 Plus • iPhone 5s\nFile information\nCompatible USB devices\nUSB communication formats\nUSB 2.0 HS (480 Mbps)\nFile formats\nFAT 16/32\nCorrespondence class\nMass storage class\n5\nA u d o\ni\n352\n5-10.

For the GAWR, see the Certification Label. For the maximum load of the tire, see the load limit at maximum cold tire inflation pressure mentioned on the sidewall of the tire. (\uf0aeP.552)\nTire types ● Summer tires\nSummer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway driving under dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same traction performance as snow tires, summer tires are inadequate for driving on snow-covered or icy roads. For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended. When installing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires. ● All season tires All season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to be adequate for driving in most winter conditions as well as for use year-round. All season tires, however, do not have adequate traction performance compared with snow tires in heavy or loose snow. Also, all season tires fall short in acceleration and handling performance compared with summer tires in highway driving. ● Snow tires For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using snow tires. If you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, construction and load capacity as the originally installed tires. Since your vehicle has radial tires as original equipment, make sure your snow tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without first checking local regulations for possible restrictions. Snow tires should be installed on all wheels. (\uf0aeP.274) ■ If the tread on snow tires wears\ndown below 0.16 in. (4 mm) The effectiveness of the tires as snow tires is lost.\n7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance\n469\nChecking the tire valves When replacing the tires, check the tire valves for deformation, cracks, and other damage.\nWARNING\nWhen inspecting or replacing\ntires\nObserve the following precautions to prevent accidents. Failure to do so may cause damage to parts of the drive train as well as dangerous handling characteristics, which may lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury. ● Do not mix tires of different makes, models or tread patterns. Also, do not mix tires of remarkably different treadwear.\nDo not use tire sizes other than those recommended by Toyota.\nDo not mix differently con-\nstructed tires (radial, bias-belted or bias-ply tires).\nDo not mix summer, all season and snow tires.\nDo not use tires that have been used on another vehicle. Do not use tires if you do not know how they were used previously.\nDo not tow if your vehicle has a compact spare tire installed.\nNOTICE\nIf tire inflation pressure of\neach tire becomes low while driving\nDo not continue driving, or your tires and/or wheels may be ruined.\n7\nM a n e n a n c e\ni\nt\na n d\nc a r e\n470\n7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance\nNOTICE\nDriving on rough roads Take particular care when driving on roads with loose surfaces or potholes. These conditions may cause losses in tire inflation pressure, reducing the cushioning ability of the tires. In addition, driving on rough roads may cause damage to the tires themselves, as well as the vehicle’s wheels and body.\nTire rotation\nRotate the tires in the order shown.\nFront\nTo equalize tire wear and extend tire life, Toyota recommends that tire rotation is carried out at the same interval as tire inspection.\nDo not fail to initialize the tire pressure warning system after tire rotation.\nTire pressure warning system\nYour vehicle is equipped with a tire pressure warning system that uses tire pressure warning valves and transmitters to detect\nlow tire inflation pressure before serious problems arise.\nThe tire pressure warning system of this vehicle adopts a 2-type warning system. \uf06c When “Adjust Pressure” is displayed (Normal Warning)\nThe tire pressure warning light comes on and a buzzer sounds when the tire inflation pressure becomes low due to natural air leakage or outside temperature.

If you add too much air, press the center of the valve to deflate.\n5 After completing the tire inflation pressure measurement and adjustment, apply soapy water to the valve and check for leakage.\n6 Put the tire valve cap back\non.\nTire inflation pressure check\ninterval\nYou should check tire inflation pressure every two weeks, or at least once a month. Do not forget to check the spare. ■ Effects of incorrect tire inflation\npressure\nDriving with incorrect tire inflation pressure may result in the following: ● Reduced fuel economy ● Reduced driving comfort and poor\nhandling\nReduced tire life due to wear ● Reduced safety ● Damage to the drive train If a tire needs frequent inflating, have it checked by your Toyota dealer.\n7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance\n479\nInstructions for checking tire\ninflation pressure\nWhen checking tire inflation pressure, observe the following: ● Check only when the tires are\ncold. If your vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours or has not been driven for more than 1 mile or 1.5 km, you will get an accurate cold tire inflation pressure reading. ● Always use a tire pressure gauge. It is difficult to judge if a tire is properly inflated based only on its appearance.\nIt is normal for the tire inflation pressure to be higher after driving as heat is generated in the tire. Do not reduce tire inflation pressure after driving.\nNever exceed the vehicle capacity weight. Passengers and luggage weight should be placed so that the vehicle is balanced.\nWARNING\nProper inflation is critical to\nsave tire performance\nKeep your tires properly inflated. If the tires are not properly inflated, the following conditions may occur which could lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury: ● Excessive wear ● Uneven wear ● Poor handling ● Possibility of blowouts resulting\nfrom overheated tires\nAir leaking from between tire and wheel\nWheel deformation and/or tire damage\n7\nM a n e n a n c e\ni\nt\na n d\nc a r e\n480\n7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance\nWARNING\nGreater possibility of tire damage while driving (due to road hazards, expansion joints, sharp edges in the road, etc.)\nNOTICE\nWhen inspecting and adjusting tire inflation pressure\nBe sure to put the tire valve caps back on. If a valve cap is not installed, dirt or moisture may get into the valve and cause an air leak, resulting in decreased tire inflation pressure.\nWheels\nIf a wheel is bent, cracked or heavily corroded, it should be replaced. Otherwise, the tire may separate from the wheel or cause a loss of handling control.\nWheel selection\nWhen replacing wheels, care should be taken to ensure that they are equivalent to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width and inset*. Replacement wheels are available at your Toyota dealer. *: Conventionally referred to as off-\nset.\nToyota does not recommend using the following: \uf06c Wheels of different sizes or\ntypes\n\uf06c Used wheels \uf06c Bent wheels that have been\nstraightened\nWhen replacing wheels The wheels of your vehicle are equipped with tire pressure warning valves and transmitters that allow the tire pressure warning system to provide advance warning in the event of a loss in tire inflation pressure. Whenever wheels are replaced, the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters must be installed. (\uf0aeP.472)\nWARNING\nWhen replacing wheels ●Do not use wheels that are a different size from those recommended in the Owner’s Manual, as this may result in a loss of handling control.\nNever use an inner tube in a leaking wheel which is designed for a tubeless tire. Doing so may result in an accident, causing death or serious injury.\nWhen installing the wheel\nnuts\nBe sure to install the wheel nuts with the tapered ends facing inward. (P.525) Installing the nuts with the tapered ends facing outward can cause the wheel to break and eventually cause the wheel to come off while driving, which could lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury.\nNever use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts. Oil and grease may cause the wheel nuts to be excessively tightened, leading to bolt or disc wheel damage. In addition, the oil or grease can cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing an accident and resulting in death or serious injury. Remove any oil or grease from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.\nUse of defective wheels pro-\nhibited\nDo not use cracked or deformed wheels. Doing so could cause the tire to leak air during driving, possibly causing an accident.\n7-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance\nNOTICE\nReplacing tire pressure warning valves and transmitters ● Because tire repair or replacement may affect the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters, make sure to have tires serviced by your Toyota dealer or other qualified service shop. In addition, make sure to purchase your tire pressure warning valves and transmitters at your Toyota dealer.\nEnsure that only genuine Toyota wheels are used on your vehicle. Tire pressure warning valves and transmitters may not work properly with non-genuine wheels. Aluminum wheel precautions (if equipped)\n\uf06c Use only Toyota wheel nuts and wheel nut wrenches designed for use with your aluminum wheels.\n\uf06c When rotating, repairing or changing your tires, check that the wheel nuts are still tight after driving 1000 miles (1600 km).\n\uf06c Use only Toyota genuine balance weights or equivalent and a plastic or rubber hammer when balancing your wheels.\n481\n7\nM a n e n a n c e\ni\nt\na n d\nc a r e\n482\n7-3.

Steps to take in an emergency\nWARNING\nAvoid abrupt maneuvering and braking. If the vehicle tires deteriorate, you could lose control of the steering wheel or the brakes. ■ If a blowout or sudden air\nleakage should occur\nPlease note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light).\nThe tire pressure warning system may not activate immediately. ■ Maintenance of the tires Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label (tire and load information label). (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label [tire and load information label], you should determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)\nYour vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunction indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. The TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light). When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended.\nAs an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS-tire pressure warning system) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) illuminates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.\nTPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) to continue to function properly.\n8-2. Steps to take in an emergency\n515\nNOTICE\nTo ensure the tire pressure warning system operates properly\nDo not install tires with different specifications or makers, as the tire pressure warning system may not operate properly.\nIf a warning message is displayed\nThe multi-information display shows warnings for system malfunctions and incorrectly performed operations, and messages that indicate a need for maintenance. When a message is displayed, perform the appropriate corrective action for the message.\nIf a warning message is displayed again after the appropriate actions have been performed, contact your Toyota dealer.\nAdditionally, if a warning light comes on or flashes at the same time that a warning message is displayed, take the appropriate corrective action for the warning light. (\uf0aeP.505)\nWarning messages The warning messages explained below may differ from the actual messages according to operation conditions and vehicle specifications. ■ Warning buzzer A buzzer may sound when a message is displayed.

Specifications\nFuel information\nYou must only use unleaded gasoline. Select octane rating of 87 (Research Octane Number 91) or higher. Use of unleaded gasoline with an octane rating lower than 87 may result in engine knocking. Persistent knocking can lead to engine damage.\nAt minimum, the gasoline you use should meet the specifications of ASTM D4814 in the U.S.A.\nGasoline quality In very few cases, driveability problems may be caused by the brand of gasoline you are using. If driveability problems persist, try changing the brand of gasoline. If this does not correct the problem, consult your Toyota dealer. ■ Recommendation of the use of gasoline containing detergent additives\nToyota recommends the use of gasoline that contains detergent additives to avoid the build-up of engine deposits.\nAll gasoline sold in the U.S.A. contains minimum detergent additives to clean and/or keep clean intake systems, per EPA’s lowest additives concentration program.\nToyota strongly recommends the use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline. For more information on Top Tier Detergent Gasoline and a list of marketers, please go to the official website www.toptiergas.com.\nRecommendation of the use of\nlow emissions gasoline\nGasolines containing oxygenates such as ethers and ethanol, as well as reformulated gasolines, are available in some cities. These fuels are typically acceptable for use, providing they meet other fuel requirements. Toyota recommends these fuels, since the formulations allow for reduced vehicle emissions. ■ Non-recommendation of the\nuse of blended gasoline\nUse only gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol. DO NOT use any flex-fuel or gasoline that could contain more than 15% ethanol, including from any pump labeled E30 (30% ethanol ]), E85 [ (85% ethanol [ ]) (which are only some examples of fuel containing more than 15% ethanol).\n]), E50 (50% ethanol [\nIf you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rating no lower than 87.\nToyota does not recommend the use of gasoline containing methanol. ■ Non-recommendation of the\nuse of gasoline containing MMT Some gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called MMT (Methylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl). Toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains MMT. If fuel containing MMT is used, your emission control system may be\nadversely affected. The malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on. If this happens, contact your Toyota dealer for service. ■ If your engine knocks ● Consult your Toyota dealer. ● You may occasionally notice light knocking for a short time while accelerating or driving uphill. This is normal and there is no need for concern.\nNOTICE\nNotice on fuel quality ●Do not use improper fuels. If improper fuels are used, the engine will be damaged. ●Do not use leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline can cause damage to your vehicle’s three-way catalytic converters causing the emission control system to malfunction.\nDo not use gasohol other than the type previously stated. Other gasohol may cause fuel system damage or vehicle performance problems.\nUsing unleaded gasoline with an octane number or rating lower than the level previously stated will cause persistent heavy knocking. At worst, this will lead to engine damage. ■ Fuel-related poor driveability If poor driveability (poor hot starting, vaporization, engine knocking, etc.) is encountered after using a different type of fuel, discontinue the use of that type of fuel.\n9-1. Specifications\nWhen refueling with gasohol Take care not to spill gasohol. It can damage your vehicle’s paint.\n551\n9\nV e h c e\ni\nl\ns p e c i f i c a t i o n s\n552\n9-1.

Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and maximum section width.\nFor example: Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A ■ Treadwear\nThe treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test course.\nFor example, a tire graded 150\n9\nV e h c e\ni\nl\ns p e c i f i c a t i o n s\n556\n9-1. Specifications\nwould wear one and a half (1 1/2) times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use. Performance may differ significantly from the norm due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences in road characteristics and climate. ■ Traction AA, A, B, C\nThe traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B and C, and they represent the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement as measured under controlled conditions on specified government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete.\nA tire marked C may have poor traction performance.\n(the highest), B, and C, representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.\nSustained high temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire failure.\nGrade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 109.\nGrades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.\nWarning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking (straight ahead) traction tests and does not include cornering (turning) traction. ■ Temperature A, B, C\nThe temperature grades are A\nWarning: The temperature grades of a tire assume that it is properly inflated and not overloaded.\nExcessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either separately or in combination, can cause heat buildup and possible tire failure.\nGlossary of tire terminology\nTire related term\nMeaning\nCold tire inflation pressure\nTire pressure when the vehicle has been parked for three hours or more, or has not been driven more than 1 mile or 1.5 km under that condition\nMaximum inflation pressure\nThe maximum cold inflated pressure to which a tire may be inflated, shown on the sidewall of the tire\nTire related term\nRecommended inflation pressure\nAccessory weight\nCurb weight\nMaximum loaded vehicle weight\nNormal occupant weight\nOccupant distribution\nProduction options weight\nRim\n9-1.

For owners\nCapteurs de classification de l'occupant du siège passager avant\nTémoin d'avertissement SRS\nVotre véhicule est équipé de COUSSINS GONFLABLES INTELLIGENTS conçus selon les normes de sécurité américaines applicables aux véhicules à moteur (FMVSS208). L'ensemble de capteurs de coussins gonflables (ECU) régule le déploiement des coussins gonflables sur la base des informations qu'il reçoit des capteurs, etc., indiqués ci-dessus dans le schéma illustrant les composants du système. Parmi ces informations figurent la gravité du choc et l'occupation du véhicule par les passagers. Le déploiement rapide des coussins gonflables est obtenu au moyen d'une réaction chimique dans les dispositifs pyrotechniques, qui produit un gaz inoffensif permettant d'amortir le mouvement des occupants.\nWARNING\nPrécautions relatives aux coussins gonflables SRS\nRespectez les précautions suivantes concernant les coussins gonflables SRS. Le non-respect de ces précautions peut occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles. ●Le conducteur et tous les passagers du véhicule doivent porter correctement leur ceinture de sécurité. Les coussins gonflables SRS sont des dispositifs supplémentaires à utiliser avec les ceintures de sécurité.\nLe coussin gonflable conducteur SRS se déploie avec une force considérable, pouvant occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles, si le conducteur se trouve très près du coussin gonflable. L'autorité fédérale chargée de la sécurité routière aux États-Unis (NHTSA) conseille: La zone à risque du coussin gonflable conducteur se situant dans les premiers 2 à 3 in. (50 à 75 mm) de déploiement, vous placer à 10 in. (250 mm) de votre coussin gonflable conducteur vous garantit une marge de sécurité. Cette distance est à mesurer entre le centre du volant et le sternum. Si vous êtes assis à moins de 10 in. (250 mm), vous pouvez changer votre position de conduite de plusieurs façons: • Reculez votre siège le plus pos-\nsible, de manière à pouvoir encore atteindre confortablement les pédales.\nWARNING\nInclinez légèrement le dossier du siège. Bien que les véhicules aient une conception différente, un grand nombre de conducteurs peuvent s'asseoir à une distance de 10 in. (250 mm), même avec le siège conducteur complètement avancé, simplement en inclinant un peu le dossier de siège. Si vous avez des difficultés à voir la route après avoir incliné le dossier de votre siège, utilisez un coussin ferme et antidérapant pour vous rehausser ou remontez le siège si votre véhicule est équipé de cette fonction.\nSi votre volant est réglable, inclinez-le vers le bas. Cela a pour effet d'orienter le coussin gonflable en direction de votre poitrine plutôt que de votre tête et de votre cou.\nRéglez votre siège selon les recommandations de la NHTSA ci-dessus, tout en conservant le contrôle des pédales, du volant et la vue des commandes du tableau de bord.\n10-1. For owners\n579\nSi vous attachez une rallonge de ceinture de sécurité aux boucles de ceinture de sécurité avant, sans l'attacher au pêne de la ceinture de sécurité, les coussins gonflables frontaux SRS déterminent que le passager avant a attaché leur ceinture de sécurité, bien que la ceinture de sécurité ne soit pas attachée. Dans ce cas, les coussins gonflables frontaux SRS peuvent ne pas se déployer correctement en cas de collision, pouvant occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles. Veillez à porter la ceinture de sécurité avec la rallonge de ceinture de sécurité.\nLe coussin gonflable passager avant SRS se déploie également avec une force considérable, pouvant occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles, si le passager avant se trouve très près du coussin gonflable. Le siège du passager avant doit être éloigné le plus possible du coussin gonflable en réglant le dossier de siège de façon à ce que le passager avant soit assis bien droit dans le siège. F o r\nLe coussin gonflable passager avant SRS se déploie également avec une force considérable, pouvant occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles, si le passager avant se trouve très près du coussin gonflable. Le siège du passager avant doit être éloigné le plus possible du coussin gonflable en réglant le dossier de siège de façon à ce que le passager avant soit assis bien droit dans le siège. F o r\no w n e r s\n580\n10-1. For owners\nWARNING\nLes nourrissons et les enfants qui ne sont pas correctement assis et/ou attachés peuvent être grièvement blessés ou tués par le déploiement d'un coussin gonflable. Un nourrisson ou un enfant trop petit pour utiliser une ceinture de sécurité doit être correctement attaché au moyen d'un siège de sécurité enfant. Toyota recommande vivement d'installer tous les nourrissons et enfants sur les sièges arrière du véhicule et de prévoir pour eux des systèmes de retenue adaptés. Les sièges arrière sont plus sûrs pour les nourrissons et les enfants que le siège du passager avant. (\uf0aeP.46) ●Ne vous asseyez pas sur le bord du siège et ne vous appuyez pas contre la planche de bord.\nNe laissez pas un enfant rester debout devant le coussin gonflable passager avant SRS ou s'asseoir sur les genoux du passager avant.\nNe laissez pas les occupants des sièges avant voyager avec un objet sur les genoux.\nNe vous appuyez pas contre la porte, le rail latéral de toit ou les montants avant, latéraux et arrière.\nNe laissez personne s'agenouiller sur les sièges passagers en appui contre la porte ou sortir la tête ou les mains à l'extérieur du véhicule.\nNe fixez rien et ne posez rien sur des emplacements tels que la planche de bord, la garniture du volant et la partie inférieure du tableau de bord. Ces éléments peuvent se transformer en projectiles lorsque les coussins gonflables conducteur, passager avant et genoux SRS se déploient.\nWARNING\nNe fixez rien aux portes, à la vitre du pare-brise, aux vitres latérales, aux montants avant et arrière, au rail latéral de toit et à la poignée de maintien.\nVéhicules sans système\nd'accès et de démarrage mains libres: Ne fixez pas d'objets lourds, pointus ou très durs, tels que des clés et des accessoires aux clés. Ces objets risquent d'entraver le déploiement du coussin gonflable de genoux SRS ou d'être projetés vers le siège conducteur par la force de déploiement du coussin gonflable, constituant ainsi un danger potentiel.\nNe suspendez aucun cintre ou objet dur aux crochets à vêtements. Tous ces objets pourraient se transformer en projectiles et causer des blessures graves, voire mortelles en cas de déploiement des coussins gonflables rideaux SRS. ●Si un cache en vinyle est placé sur la zone où le coussin gonflable de genoux du conducteur SRS se déploie, assurez-vous de le retirer.\n10-1. For owners\n581\nN'utilisez aucun accessoire de siège recouvrant les zones de déploiement des coussins gonflables latéraux SRS, car il risque de gêner le déploiement des coussins gonflables SRS. De tels accessoires peuvent empêcher les coussins gonflables latéraux de fonctionner correctement, désactiver le système ou entraîner le déploiement accidentel des coussins gonflables latéraux, occasionnant des blessures graves, voire mortelles.\nÉvitez de faire subir des chocs ou des pressions excessives aux parties renfermant les composants de coussins gonflables SRS ou aux portes avant. En effet, cela pourrait entraîner un dysfonctionnement des coussins gonflables SRS.\nNe touchez aucun composant immédiatement après le déploiement (gonflage) des coussins gonflables SRS, car ils peuvent être chauds.\nSi vous avez des difficultés à respirer après le déploiement des coussins gonflables SRS, ouvrez une porte ou une vitre pour faire entrer de l'air frais, ou bien descendez du véhicule si cela ne présente pas de danger. Essuyez tout résidu dès que possible afin d'éviter d'éventuelles irritations de la peau. ● Si les parties renfermant les coussins gonflables SRS, comme les garnitures du volant et des montants avant et arrière, sont endommagées ou craquelées, faites-les remplacer par votre concessionnaire Toyota. o w n e r s\n582\n10-1. For owners\nWARNING\nNe placez rien sur le siège du passager avant, comme un coussin par exemple. Cela a pour conséquence de répartir le poids du passager sur toute la surface du siège, ce qui empêche le capteur de détecter correctement le poids du passager. En conséquence, les coussins gonflables frontaux SRS du passager avant risquent de ne pas se déployer en cas de collision. ■ Modification et mise au rebut des composants du système de coussins gonflables SRS Ne mettez pas votre véhicule au rebut et ne procédez à aucune des modifications suivantes sans consulter votre concessionnaire Toyota. Les coussins gonflables SRS peuvent ne pas fonctionner correctement ou se déployer (se gonfler) accidentellement, provoquant la mort ou de graves blessures. ●Installation, dépose, démon-\ntage et réparation des coussins gonflables SRS\nRéparations, modifications, démontage ou remplacement du volant, du tableau de bord, de la planche de bord, des sièges ou de leur garnissage, des montants avant, latéraux et arrière, des rails latéraux de toit, des panneaux de porte avant, des garnitures de porte avant ou des haut-parleurs de porte avant\nModifications du panneau de porte avant (par exemple, perçage d'un trou dans le panneau)\nRéparations ou modifications des ailes avant, du pare-chocs avant ou des flancs de l'habitacle\nInstallation d'un protège-calandre (pare-buffle, pare-kangourou, etc.), de chasse-neige, de treuils ou d'un porte-bagages de toit\nModifications du système de suspension du véhicule\nInstallation d'appareils électroniques tels que les émetteurs/récepteurs radios mobiles et les lecteurs CD\nModifications de votre véhicule pour une personne atteinte d'un handicap physique\nIndex\nWhat to do if.
