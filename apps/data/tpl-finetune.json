    "input": "Side 1 = 4\nSide 2 = 6\nSide 3 = 8",    
    "output": "The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides. In this case, the perimeter would be the sum of side 1, side 2, and side 3. So, \nPerimeter = Side 1 + Side 2 + Side 3\n= 4 + 6 + 8\n= 18\n\nTherefore, the perimeter of the triangle is 18 units."}
