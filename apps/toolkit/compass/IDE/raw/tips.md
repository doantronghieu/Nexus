# Practical Guide to Using AI Coding Assistants

## Understanding Your Codebase First
Before effectively using AI assistance, you need to:
- Have a good high-level understanding of your code structure
- Know which files typically need to change for specific features
- Be able to recognize when code is becoming too coupled or unmaintainable
- Be familiar enough with the code to spot when AI suggestions don't match your patterns

## The Three Main Tools

### 1. Tab Completion
**Best Use Cases:**
- When you know exactly what files need to change
- Modifying existing code patterns
- Quick iterations on known structures

**How to Use Effectively:**
- Copy an existing similar file as a base
- Start typing the new implementation
- Let tab completion fill in the patterns
- Sometimes you need to "let it cook" - give it a moment to process
- Verify the completions match your codebase patterns

**Example from Video:**
```
1. Copied tree.ts to create grenade.ts
2. Started typing basic structure
3. Used tab completion to fill details
4. Added necessary asset references
5. Updated entity maps and registries
```

### 2. Command-K (Highlight and Prompt)
**Best Use Cases:**
- Implementing well-known algorithms
- Refactoring existing code
- Working with repetitive JSON/config files
- Quick improvements to code quality

**Common Use Patterns:**
- Highlight code and ask to "improve this"
- Request specific algorithm implementations
- Add new parameters to multiple entries
- Make code more readable

**Example Commands:**
- "Add a size param to all entries"
- "Generate a pathfinding algorithm from zombie to human"
- "Improve this code"
- "Make this look like [reference file]"
- "DRY this up"

### 3. Chat/Composer
**Best Use Cases:**
- Implementing new features
- When you're tired or doing simple additions
- Understanding existing code
- Working across multiple files

**Tips for Effective Use:**
- Be very specific in your prompts
- Provide example files as reference
- List all the places that need updating
- Expect to debug and iterate
- Use "continue" if it seems stuck

**Example Workflow:**
```
1. Write detailed feature request
2. Reference similar existing features
3. Specify files to update
4. Let it work (can do other things while waiting)
5. Review and fix any issues
6. Use error messages to guide fixes
```

## Debugging AI-Generated Code

### When Code Crashes
1. Copy the entire stack trace
2. Feed it back to the AI
3. Let it fix specific issues
4. Iterate until working

### Common Issues to Watch For
- Missing registry entries
- Incorrect asset references
- Type mismatches
- Missing imports
- Wrong code patterns

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple
- Begin with tab completion
- Move to command-K for specific changes
- Use composer for larger features

### 2. Review Everything
- Don't blindly accept AI suggestions
- Verify against existing patterns
- Test all changes
- Check for type errors

### 3. Provide Context
- Reference existing similar code
- Specify file locations
- Mention related systems
- Point out patterns to follow

### 4. Iterate and Debug
- Expect first attempts to need fixes
- Use error messages as guidance
- Build features incrementally
- Test each step

## Tips for Different Scenarios

### New Features
1. Find similar existing feature
2. Use as reference in prompts
3. List all necessary file changes
4. Expect integration issues
5. Debug systematically

### Code Improvements
1. Highlight target code
2. Request specific improvements
3. Review changes carefully
4. Test functionality
5. Iterate if needed

### Understanding Code
1. Ask about specific features
2. Request file relationships
3. Follow code paths
4. Get implementation details

## When Not to Use AI

- When you don't understand your codebase
- For critical security features
- When accuracy is crucial
- If you can't verify the output

Remember: AI is a tool to enhance productivity, not a replacement for understanding your code. The better you know your codebase, the more effectively you can use AI assistance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Best Practices:**
    *   **File Organization:**  When creating real software, do not jumble the rendering of the app, CSS, and J6 into one file.
    *  **Clear Directory:**  Make sure to identify the current project directory and create a structured codebase.
    *   **Version Control:** Use Git for version control, leveraging branches for new features and changes, with the main branch for stable versions. Use commands like `get add .`, `git commit -m "your comment"`, and `git push origin main` frequently.
    *   **High-Risk Variables**: Use a `.env` file to store high-risk variables and remember to exclude this from being pushed to the cloud.

*   **Workflow for Code Understanding:**
    1.  **Highlight Code:** Select the code you wish to understand within Cursor AI.
    2.  **Use Command (`command/control + L`):** Engage with the AI assistant using the chat command.
    3.  **Ask Clear Questions:** Pose specific questions about the code such as what does 'copy' mean or what does strick mode mean.

*   **Workflow for Code Generation:**
    1.  **Highlight Code or Area (Optional):**  If you want to add code related to an area of the code highlight the specific area
    2.  **Use Command (`command/control + K`):**  Access the code generation feature.
    3.  **Describe in Layman's Terms:** Request code using clear, specific instructions, and do not use complex coding jargon if possible.
    4.  **Refine Iteratively:**  Review the generated code, make necessary edits, and adjust your prompt for better code outputs.

*   **Implementation Tips**
   *  **External Terminal:** For complex projects with a front end and a back end consider using an external terminal.
     * **Terminal Commands:** Create a cheat sheet of commonly used commands like `npm start`, `cd directory`, `npm install react`, etc.
     * **Node.js Installation:** Make sure to install node.js, so the mpm command works as intended.
     *  **Local Host 3000:** Localhost 3000 is an environment that allows you to code a website without having to connect to the internet.
     *  **Github Workflow:** Use the command line tools to connect your local repository to Github using the proper access token and all the relevant information.
     * **Firebase Setup** Ensure all the right tools are installed so that you can connect a React Application to Firebase. You will need node.js, Firebase tools, and other Javascript dependencies.
   * **Troubleshooting:** When runing into issues, make sure you are in the right directory, you have the right access tokens, you install the necessary dependencies, and then if you are still facing issues, ask Chad gbt with the specific error.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   **Model Selection:**
    *   Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for general coding tasks, speed, reliability, step-by-step prompting, and debugging.
    *   Use OpenAI-o1 mini for code generation, massive output tokens, one-shot prompts and debugging.
    *   Use OpenAI-o1 preview for complex reasoning, but it may be slower and less reliable for simple tasks, and should only be used if needed.
    *   Use GPT-4 for initial planning and complex instructions but switch to other models after to optimize speed and output.
    *  Use local LLMs if applicable to reduce cost and speed up the process, always test all local LLMs.
*   **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Be very specific and detailed in your prompt, especially when using 01 models.
     * Use different types of prompts depending on the task, e.g. use visual prompts for UI design, use XML prompts for complex tasks, use one-shot for o1 mini and step-by-step for claude and gpt4.
    *   Structure prompts using XML tags and visual aids where applicable.
    *   Use structured outputs when extracting information, needing specific formatting, or data validation.
    *   Start with a simple prompt and iterate based on the results.
    *   Use clear actions in the prompt to guide the LLM.
*   **Workflow Strategies:**
      *  If streaming is applicable for the front end use it to create a better real-time user experience, always prioritize speed and real-time integration when it's an option.
      * Always try to combine different models for specific tasks, use the chat and composer feature to create pipelines of different LLMs and AI tools.
       *   Prioritize creating a minimal viable product before focusing on all features and complex implementations.
    *   Create a detailed plan using a project or a large language model before starting development.
    *   Separate file management and code generation, so you don't have to manually create files and directories after a large code generation.
    *   Use the chat feature to get different prompts and ideas.
    *   Use the composer feature to generate complex folder structures and files with placeholder content before coding.
    *   Use cursor rules to set up system settings that optimize specific types of coding tasks (e.g., structured outputs).
    *   Use the `contrl+enter` command in cursor to use the full code base as context.
    *  Leverage the `contrl+l` command in cursor to generate visual prompts and change UI elements easily.
      *   Use placeholder content to rapidly prototype and create a minimal viable product as soon as possible.
      *  Always emphasize modular component design to promote code reusability.
    *   Start with a core prompt, extract the output, and use the output as context for the next part to increase the chances of success.
     *    Always emphasize code reusability, and use modular design principles to easily set up new tools.
 *   Always try to iterate on features and prioritize a minimal viable product, and then extend the application with new features and content.
*   **Cursor IDE Tips:**
    *   Use the chat for prompts, code generation, and debugging.
    *   Use the composer for batch file creation, large code implementation, and converting existing components.
    *   Use the `apply` feature for fast changes.
    *   Use the mention (`@`) to reference specific files and folders.
    *   Utilize the cursor rule for setting up specific project or style preferences.
*   **Debugging:**
    *   Use error messages to get detailed help on debugging.
    *  Use chat to iterate through error messages to find an accurate fix.
    *   Use the chat feature with code base awareness to quickly iterate through and fix bugs.
*   **Back-end Notes:**
    *   Use Firebase Functions for serverless applications and Stripe integration.
    *   Use environment variables to store API keys with specific restrictions.
    *   Use a test key before using a live key.
    *   Use a capture method to confirm payments before completing a transaction.
    *   Use console logs to check the status of the functions.
*   **Deployment:**
     * Always do a production build before deploying a web application.
     * Test all the features both manually and automatically before making the application live, try to cover edge cases and user interactions.
     * Use a CDN to increase the performance of your web application.
     *   Use robots.txt and sitemap.xml to increase the chances of your web application being discovered.
*   **Cyber Security:**
    *   Always sanitize text inputs in a web form to avoid injection attacks and vulnerabilities.
    *  Seek expert advice for implementing serious cyber security measures.
*   **Performance:**
    *   Always prioritize performance when creating a UI and optimize where applicable.
    *  Defer rendering components, or use a CDN for fast loading.
    *  Reduce the amount of API requests by caching the result locally.
    *   Always test the different components to see if they work as intended.
  *  Use AI tools to review and refactor your code to further optimize performance.
*  **Testing:**
     *  Test your application to try to cover all edge cases and user interactions.
     *  Test all UI elements with manual checks to ensure there are no bugs.
* **API Keys**
     * Always handle API keys securely and use an EnV file.
     * Use restricted API keys only for the relevant features.

This guide provides practical insights based on the demonstrated usage of AI coding assistants. It focuses on core principles, workflow strategies, and implementation tips that are applicable to a wide range of AI coding tools and projects.

## I. Core Principles

1.  **Embrace Iteration:**  Don't expect perfect results from a single prompt. View the interaction with an AI assistant as a collaborative process of iterative refinement. Be prepared to provide follow-up instructions, corrections, and clarifications.
2.  **Clear and Specific Prompts:** The more specific your prompts, the better the AI will be able to understand and address your needs. Use clear and concise language, and provide all the necessary context.
3.  **Use Chain of Thought Reasoning When Required:** If you need more detailed information on a process or if you need to understand the problem, ask the AI to use chain of thought reasoning.
4.  **Leverage Context:** Use file and folder tags to pass relevant files or folders to the context of your prompts. Use a specific tag such as `[# file:]` to specify that a file should be added to the context of the prompt.
5.  **Test Frequently:**  Always test the generated code immediately after changes have been applied. Use a command such as `npm run dev` or the equivalent command to run the project and debug the implementation.
6. **Verify the Output:** The AI assistant does not always consider the output correctly. If you are expecting a specific visual output or the correct implementation for a specific task, make sure you verify that the final implementation matches that vision.
7. **Use the Proper Context for Different Modes:** Be aware that the dedicated code generation mode is different from the chat mode and the results may differ between the two modes.
8. **Be Open to Failures:** The AI coding assistants still make mistakes. Do not expect that the results will always be perfect.

## II. Workflow Strategies

1.  **Start Simple:** Begin with a clear, well-defined task. Do not try to tackle the whole project in one single step.
2.  **Break Down Complex Tasks:** Divide larger projects into smaller, more manageable steps. Use project planning prompts to guide the overall architecture and workflow.
3.  **Focus on Functionality:** Initially, concentrate on getting the core functionality working. Refine the code and enhance the user interface later.
4.  **Prioritize Core Features:** Before moving to other features, start by focusing on the core features of your project.
5.  **Address Errors Immediately:** Don't ignore errors. When encountering an error, use the AI assistant to explain the source of the issue and to provide a step by step plan to fix that error.
6.  **Control the Narrative:** Don't let the AI assistant make decisions for you, unless you want it to. If you have a specific idea of how the project should look and feel, provide that information in the prompt and then let the AI assistant fill the gaps.
7. **If you feel like you are stuck, start a new session:** Sometimes the AI assistant will start to fall behind and will not implement the prompts correctly. If you see this happening, it's sometimes better to start a new chat window/code generation window.

## III. Implementation Tips

1.  **State Management:** Be specific about state management strategies if required. Don't rely on the AI to implicitly add proper state management.
2.  **Database Integration:** Be very specific in your request and let the AI assistant fill the necessary code for database integration.
3.  **UI Libraries:** If you require a specific UI framework, explicitly specify this in your prompts and be ready to guide the AI through the setup process.
4.  **Modularity:** For larger projects always ask the AI to generate modularized and optimized code. Be specific in your instruction on how to break down the different components for a given application.
5.  **File Organization:** Ask the AI assistant to add the specific code into separate files if the current approach is not what you need.
6. **Use Web Search Feature:** If the AI assistant's information is not up to date, or if you need specific information, use the web search feature of your model to gain additional insights.
7. **Use the Latest Models:** The performance of different models differs significantly. If you have access to newer and more performant models, you should always prioritize them.

## IV. Known Limitations

1.  **Early Development Stage:** Understand that AI coding tools are still in active development. You can sometimes expect bugs, errors, or inconsistencies in the implementation.
2.  **Code Quality:** The generated code might not be optimized for your specific application, may need further refactoring and/or restructuring.
3. **Integration Complexity:** Integrating the AI with multiple tools and libraries can present some challenges. Be aware of the integration process and the steps necessary to work with those tools.
4. **Inconsistencies Between Modes:** The AI assistant might perform differently in different modes, like chat or the code generation mode.
5. **API limitations:** If you are using the API of an AI model, make sure that you are correctly setting up all the necessary requirements.

## V. Connecting Different AI Models

1.  **API Key:** To connect an AI model, you will need to generate an API key from the API provider and then add it to the settings tab inside of your code editor.
2.  **Model Name:** You have to specify the name of the model that you want to use in the settings tab.
