## Universal Code Standards

### TypeScript Usage & Configuration
- Enable and maintain strict mode
- Avoid using 'any' or type assertions
- Prefer interfaces over types for objects
- Use union types and type guards for runtime checks
- Create proper type definitions for all data structures
- Leverage TypeScript's built-in utility types
- Configure proper path aliases and compiler options
- Use proper tsconfig inheritance
- Avoid enums in favor of const objects or unions
- Implement proper generic constraints
- Use discriminated unions where appropriate
- Leverage mapped and conditional types

### Code Style & Structure
- Files/Directories: kebab-case (e.g., user-profile)
- Components/Classes: PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile)
- Variables/Functions: camelCase (e.g., getUserData)
- Constants/Env Variables: UPPERCASE
- Boolean Variables: Use prefixes (is, has, should)
- Event Handlers: Use 'handle' prefix (e.g., handleClick)
- Keep functions small and focused (less than 20 lines)
- Use early returns to avoid nested conditions
- Keep nesting to a maximum of 2 levels deep
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions and types
- One export per file
- Group related components in feature-based directories
- Place tests alongside the code they test
- Follow consistent import ordering
- Maintain proper file organization
- Use meaningful and descriptive names

### Function Design & Data Management
- Follow RORO (Receive Object, Return Object) pattern
- Maximum 4 parameters per function
- Implement early validation and returns
- Keep functions pure when possible
- Use proper error handling and typing
- Avoid side effects in pure functions

- Provide usage examples
- Handle proper versioning
- Implement proper changelog
- Use proper documentation tools
- Handle proper translations
- Implement proper search



### B. TypeScript Implementation

TypeScript is not just a feature but a core part of the development methodology:

* **Core Practices:**
  * Strict mode is always enabled for robust type safety.
  * Precise types are used and `any` is avoided as much as possible.
  * Interfaces are used over types for defining object shapes.
  * Proper generic constraints are applied to create reusable and type-safe components.
  * Type inference is leveraged to reduce code verbosity.
* **Advanced Patterns:**
  * Utility types are used for concise type transformations.
  * Conditional types are used when type logic is dependent on conditions.
  * Mapped types are used to transform types consistently.
  * Module augmentation is used when extending existing types.
  * Declaration merging is used when combining type declarations.
  * Template literal types are used for string manipulation and creation.
  * Const assertions are used for more precise literal types.
  * Type guards are used to narrow types based on runtime conditions.
