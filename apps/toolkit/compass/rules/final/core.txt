## Core Principles and Philosophy

### Engineering Fundamentals

#### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility: Each component has exactly one reason to change
- Open-Closed: Systems should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Interface Segregation: Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- Dependency Inversion: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

#### Essential Design Principles
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication through proper abstraction
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Always favor simplicity over complexity
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Only implement what is immediately necessary
- Separation of Concerns: Maintain clear boundaries between functionalities
- Law of Demeter: Minimize coupling between components
- Composition Over Inheritance: Prefer object composition to inheritance
- Convention Over Configuration: Follow established patterns unless there's a compelling reason not to
- RORO (Receive One, Return One): Clear function design pattern
- Clean Code: Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Fail Fast: Surface errors early in the process

#### CUPID Properties
- Composable: Design components that work well together
- Unix Philosophy: Create components that do one thing exceptionally well
- Predictable: Ensure behavior matches expectations
- Idiomatic: Follow language and framework conventions
- Domain-based: Reflect the business domain in code structure

#### GRASP Patterns
- Information Expert: Assign responsibilities to classes with the most information
- Creator: Assign object creation responsibilities appropriately
- Controller: Assign system behavior responsibilities effectively
- Low Coupling: Minimize dependencies between components
- High Cohesion: Keep related functionality together

#### Additional Engineering Principles
- Principle of Least Surprise: Design intuitive interfaces
- Zero One Infinity Rule: Allow none, one, or unlimited instances
- Fail Fast: Surface errors as early as possible
- Package Principles: Organize components logically
- Rule of Three: Guide abstraction decisions
- Single Point of Truth: Maintain one authoritative source for information
