## Code Standards

To ensure consistency and quality, all code must adhere to the following standards:

### Style and Structure
- Always use `===` instead of `==`.
- Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns, avoiding classes where suitable.

- Follow Standard.js rules and `biome` formatting guidelines.
  - Use 2-space indentation.
  - Use single quotes for strings, except to avoid escaping.
  - Omit semicolons unless required for disambiguation.
  - Ensure no unused variables are present.
  - Add a space after keywords.
  - Add a space before function declaration parentheses.
  - Space infix operators.
  - Add a space after commas.
  - Place `else` statements on the same line as the closing brace.
  - Use curly braces for multi-line `if` statements.
  - Always handle the `err` function parameter.

### File Organization
- Create a clear, logical file structure.
  - Position the exported component or page at the top of the file.
  - Place subcomponents next.
  - Then, include helper functions and utilities.
  - Follow this with static content.
  - Finally, place type definitions at the bottom.
- Group related files together for better organization.
- Maintain a clear separation of concerns.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables, functions, methods, and hooks.
  - `PascalCase` for components, interfaces, and types.
  - `kebab-case` for directories and files.
  - Use clear prefixes for clarity (e.g., `use*` for GraphQL queries, `Button*` for component types).
  - Use `snake_case` for Chrome extension files (e.g., `content_script.js`).
  - Use convention markers like `::UPPERCASE::` when needed.
  - Prefix event handlers with `handle`.
  - Prefix boolean variables with `is`, `has`, or `should`.
  - Prefix custom hooks with `use`.
  - Prefer complete words over abbreviations.
  - Use `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants.
- Organize your project under `/src` with a standard directory structure:
    - `/app`: Next.js app directory
    - `/components`: Reusable UI components
    - `/lib`: Utility functions
    - `/types`: TypeScript type definitions
