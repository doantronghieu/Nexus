# Consilience

## Overview
Consilience is an advanced question-answering platform powered by multiple LLM agents working in concert. By orchestrating specialized AI agents across different knowledge domains, Consilience delivers comprehensive and accurate answers to virtually any question.

## Core Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents collaborate to provide thorough responses
- **Cross-Domain Knowledge**: Seamlessly integrates information across different fields
- **Source Transparency**: Clear attribution for all information sources
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improves through user interactions

## Philosophy
Consilience—the unity of knowledge across disciplines—drives our approach. By bringing together diverse perspectives and information sources, we create a more complete understanding than any single agent could provide.

## Status
This project is currently under development. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
