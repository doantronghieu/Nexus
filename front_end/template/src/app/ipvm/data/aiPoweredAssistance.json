    "cameraPlacement": "Based on your floor plan, I recommend positioning cameras at the following locations to maximize coverage while minimizing blind spots:\n\n1. Main entrance: Use a 4MP dome camera with 110Â° field of view\n2. Hallway intersections: Deploy 2MP cameras with corridor format\n3. Parking area: Consider 5MP cameras with IR capabilities for low-light conditions\n\nThis configuration provides approximately 95% coverage of critical areas while staying within your budget constraints.",
    "marketTrends": "The security camera market is currently experiencing several significant trends:\n\n1. Cloud-based VMS solutions are growing at 24% CAGR, outpacing on-premise systems\n2. AI-powered analytics are becoming standard features rather than premium add-ons\n3. Multi-sensor cameras are gaining market share due to their cost-efficiency for wide area coverage\n4. Cybersecurity features are increasingly becoming a primary selection criterion\n\nBased on your organization's profile, focusing on cloud-compatible cameras with built-in analytics would align with these market directions."
